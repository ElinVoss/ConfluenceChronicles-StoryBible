# Canon Deltas — N01: "The Grip That Holds"

## Purpose

This document captures novella-specific canon clarifications and tensions for N01. All entries must align with global canon; this file documents interpretation, not contradiction.

## Key Canon Points for N01

### 1. Pre-Terminology Era

**Canon Alignment:**
N01 takes place in the immediate aftermath of The Piercing, before any systematic understanding of Soulpulse exists. Per knowledge gates, characters DO NOT use terms like "resonance," "principles," "veins," "Hollowing," or "Confluence."

**N01-Specific Application:**
- Magic is described as "the gift," "the ability," "his power," etc.
- Sensory language only: warmth, coolness, tingling, pulling, exhaustion
- Observations are personal and anecdotal, never systematic
- Characters speculate but don't theorize formally

**Forbidden Terms in N01:**
- Resonance (technical)
- Four Principles or any named principles
- Veins or vein network
- Hollowing
- Confluence
- Echo stacking
- Suppression devices
- Faction names based on magic type
- God-vessel transformations

---

### 2. Instinctive Magic Use

**Canon Alignment:**
Characters discover abilities through trial and error. Magic feels miraculous, unpredictable, and emotionally driven.

**N01-Specific Application:**
- Jhace's healing: Instinctive response to injury; guided by emotion and will
- Tiffani's shaping: Precision-based but not understood mechanically
- No training systems exist yet
- Success varies; failure is common and costly
- Characters learn limits through pain and exhaustion

---

### 3. Physical Costs Baseline

**Canon Alignment:**
Per knowledge gates, Jhace's vein-burn begins in N01 (scaffold incident). Other costs establish patterns that escalate across the saga.

**N01-Specific Cost Tracking:**
- **Jhace:** Vein-burn disc appears on left forearm (~2.5cm by end of N01); tremor in left hand; exhaustion proportional to healing scale
- **Tiffani:** Joint stiffness (hands especially); mental exhaustion from precision work; coolness in extremities
- **Mobel:** Early isolation symptoms (numbness, social withdrawal, sensory sensitivity)
- **Venn/Eries:** Vitality drain (fatigue, looking older than age, need for rest)

**Note:** These costs are mysterious to characters; they don't understand why they occur or how to prevent them.

---

### 4. Bram's Death as Trauma Anchor

**Canon Alignment:**
Bram (Jhace's mentor) dies despite Jhace's healing attempts. This establishes that magic has limits and overuse is dangerous.

**N01-Specific Application:**
- Bram's death occurs in Act I (backstory or flashback)
- Jhace pushed too hard, too long
- Felt resistance and wrongness but couldn't save him
- Left Jhace with burn scar (first vein-burn incident) and fear of loss
- Establishes emotional stakes: magic can't fix everything

---

### 5. Chloen's Versatility

**Canon Alignment:**
Chloen can use multiple types of magic (healing AND shaping), which is unusual but not unique. This foreshadows dual-principle potential in N04-N05.

**N01-Specific Application:**
- Chloen is younger and less experienced than Jhace or Tiffani
- Can heal (like Jhace) and shape (like Tiffani) but exhausts faster
- Characters observe this but don't understand its significance
- No formal explanation given; treated as curiosity
- Sets up future revelation without spoiling

---

### 6. Pre-Factional Era

**Canon Alignment:**
N01 occurs before factions formalize. Groups are forming informally around different approaches to power, but no names or doctrines exist yet.

**N01-Specific Application:**
- Council bureaucracy trying to manage chaos
- Informal clusters: those who heal vs. those who build vs. those who preserve
- Tension between "use it freely" and "be cautious" philosophies
- No organized factions, no formal conflict
- Social pressure and judgment, but no warfare

---

## Canon Tensions & Resolutions

### Tension 1: How Much Can Characters Speculate?

**Tension:**
Characters are intelligent and curious. How much can they theorize about magic without violating knowledge gates?

**Resolution:**
Characters can observe patterns and ask questions, but:
- Observations stay personal and anecdotal ("I feel warmth; she feels coolness")
- Speculation remains uncertain ("Maybe it's different for everyone?")
- No systematic frameworks emerge
- Theories are proven wrong or remain unresolved
- Use internal monologue to show curiosity without revealing future knowledge

**Example Allowed:**
*"Jhace wondered if the warmth he felt was unique to him, or if others felt it too. Tiffani's magic felt different—colder, sharper—but he couldn't explain why."*

**Example Forbidden:**
*"Jhace realized there must be different types of resonance, each tied to a specific principle."*

---

### Tension 2: Cost Visibility Without Systematic Understanding

**Tension:**
Canon requires all costs to be visible on-page, but N01 characters don't understand the Soulpulse system.

**Resolution:**
- Show costs physically and emotionally
- Characters notice patterns but don't understand mechanisms
- Use sensory language: pain, exhaustion, tremor, stiffness, burns
- Characters fear costs but can't predict or prevent them
- Medical language is observational, not diagnostic

**Example Allowed:**
*"The burn on his forearm throbbed. It had appeared after he healed the child, a disc of angry red skin that wouldn't fade. He didn't know why."*

**Example Forbidden:**
*"The vein-burn measured 2.5 centimeters, indicating moderate overuse of his Wholeness resonance."*

---

### Tension 3: Foreshadowing vs. Anachronism

**Tension:**
N01 must set up future developments (dual-principle, god-vessels, Confluence) without revealing them.

**Resolution:**
- Use subtle character moments that gain meaning in retrospect
- Avoid any direct hints or prophecies
- Characters can feel "wrongness" or "difference" without understanding it
- Subtext is fine; text is not

**Example Allowed (Foreshadowing Mobel's Transformation):**
*"Mobel sat apart from the others, hands pressed to his temples. 'Too loud,' he muttered, though the room was quiet."*

**Example Forbidden:**
*"Mobel felt the isolation deepening, the Purity principle consuming him. He wondered if he would become something else."*

---

## Summary

N01 operates in a state of **informed ignorance**: Characters experience the Soulpulse system but don't understand it. Magic feels miraculous, costs are mysterious, and the future is uncertain. This creates dramatic tension while preserving knowledge gates for N02-N05 revelations.

**When in doubt:** Use sensory language, keep speculation vague, show costs physically, and trust that readers will appreciate the journey from mystery to understanding.

# Core Cast — N01: "The Grip That Holds"

## POV Characters

---

### **Jhace Torrins** (POV)

**Role in N01:** Primary POV; structural worker discovering healing abilities; emotional anchor for cost-of-power theme.

**Age/Background:**
- Early third smelting (mid-twenties)
- Structural worker in Coreven—Underface (scaffold and marry-point repair)
- Lost mentor Bram to failed healing attempt (before N01 begins)
- Practical, physical, action-oriented
- Unmarried; focused on work and community

**Arc: Brute-Force Problem Solver → Recognizing Limits**

**Beginning State (Ch 1-3):**
- Believes effort and will can solve any problem
- Uses healing instinctively but doesn't understand it
- Still grieving Bram's death; guilt-driven
- Pushes himself too hard out of fear of failing others
- Sees magic as a tool, not a burden

**Key Relationships:**
- **Tiffani Merrow:** Professional respect turns to deeper connection; he admires her precision; they balance each other (warmth vs. coolness, intuition vs. calculation)
- **Mobel Kress:** Old friend; Jhace worries about Mobel's increasing isolation but doesn't know how to help
- **Venn Eries:** Philosophical counterpoint; Venn challenges Jhace's brute-force approach
- **Chloen:** Younger worker he healed once; sees potential but worries about cost

**Pressure Points:**
- Scaffold incident (Ch 3): Forces him to overuse healing, triggering vein-burn
- Failed healing attempt (Ch 8): Realizes he can't save everyone
- Tiffani's vulnerability (Ch 11): Must choose between protecting her and respecting her autonomy
- Climactic choice (Ch 14): Survival costs more than surrender

**Costs Across N01:**
- **Ch 3:** Vein-burn disc appears on left forearm (angry red, ~1.5cm) after scaffold healing
- **Ch 5:** Left hand tremor begins; minor but noticeable
- **Ch 8:** Vein-burn expands to ~2.0cm; pain increases with each use
- **Ch 11:** Tremor worsens; exhaustion deeper; warmth feels harder to summon
- **Ch 14:** Vein-burn reaches ~2.5cm; tremor permanent; accepts this as the price

**End State (Ch 15):**
- Understands that magic has limits; not everything can be fixed
- Still uses healing but with caution and awareness
- Vein-burn and tremor are permanent reminders
- Relationship with Tiffani deepened through shared vulnerability
- New equilibrium: power balanced with cost, hope tempered with realism

**Voice Notes:**
- **Prose Style:** Blunt, physical, action-oriented; short sentences during stress; longer reflections in quiet moments
- **Internal Monologue:** Emotional undercurrent beneath practical surface; guilt and fear drive decisions; uses craft metaphors (forge, scaffold, marry-point)
- **Speech Patterns:** Direct, practical; avoids flowery language; occasional dark humor
- **Physicality:** Always aware of his body; magic feels physical (warmth, pull, exhaustion)

**Sample Voice:**
*The scaffold groaned. Jhace's hands moved before his mind caught up—warmth spreading from chest to fingertips, pulling toward the cracked marry-point. The world sang along. For a breath, it held.*

*Then the burn started.*

### **Tiffani Merrow** (POV)

**Role in N01:** Secondary POV; glassworks precision shaper; embodies "perfection as prison" theme.

**Age/Background:**
- Late second to early third smelting (early twenties)
- Master glassworker; creates intricate marry-points and structural glass
- Reputation for flawless precision; known for never accepting "good enough"
- Unmarried; work-focused; small social circle
- Lost mother to structural collapse three castings ago

**Arc: Precision as Control → Perfection as Prison**

**Beginning State (Ch 2-4):**
- Uses precision work to maintain control and order
- Magic feels like extension of her craft skill
- Believes perfection prevents disaster
- Avoids vulnerability; keeps emotions contained
- Sees magic as elegant solution to chaos

**Key Relationships:**
- **Jhace Torrins:** Initially skeptical of his brute-force approach; grows to respect his emotional honesty; allows herself to be vulnerable with him
- **Mobel Kress:** Fellow precision worker; she notices his isolation before others do
- **Venn Eries:** Intellectual equal; they discuss philosophy and limits
- **Council contacts:** Professional relationships; she's respected but not close with anyone

**Pressure Points:**
- Perfect marry-point shatters (Ch 6): Realizes precision doesn't guarantee success
- Cost becomes visible (Ch 9): Stiffness in hands threatens her identity as craftsperson
- Jhace's vulnerability (Ch 12): Seeing his scars forces her to confront her own
- Climactic choice (Ch 14): Must choose imperfect survival over perfect death

**Costs Across N01:**
- **Ch 4:** Joint stiffness begins (subtle; fingers slow to flex in morning)
- **Ch 6:** Stiffness increases; pain during fine work
- **Ch 9:** Hands visibly slower; range of motion reduced; coolness in fingertips
- **Ch 12:** Mental exhaustion compounds physical; concentration harder to maintain
- **Ch 14:** Significant stiffness; pain constant; accepts imperfection in herself

**End State (Ch 15):**
- Understands that perfection is impossible and costly
- Still precise but accepts "good enough" when necessary
- Stiffness is permanent; adapts her technique
- Relationship with Jhace provides emotional anchor
- New equilibrium: excellence without perfectionism, control balanced with acceptance

**Voice Notes:**
- **Prose Style:** Elegant with punched profanity; controlled until breaking point; uses architectural and geometric metaphors
- **Internal Monologue:** Sharp, analytical, self-critical; mental checklists and calculations; fear of failure beneath surface
- **Speech Patterns:** Precise, formal in professional contexts; more relaxed with Jhace; uses technical craft terms
- **Physicality:** Awareness of hands and joints; magic feels mental and precise (cool clarity, geometric patterns)

**Sample Voice:**
*The glass sang as she shaped it—cool, crystalline clarity running through her mind like geometric equations solving themselves. Perfect. She needed perfect. Anything less would crack, would fail, would kill someone like mother's collapse had.*

*Her fingers stiffened. The glass wobbled.*

*Fuck.*

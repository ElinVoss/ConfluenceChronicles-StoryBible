# Local Limits and Edges — N01: "The Grip That Holds"

## Purpose

This document defines how Soulpulse magic works in N01, what characters know and don't know, costs and limits, failure modes, and sensory FX. Everything here aligns with N01 knowledge gates: instinctive, miraculous, unpredictable, without systematic understanding.

---

## Part 1: What Magic Can Do (N01 Scope)

### **Healing (Warmth-Type)**

**Practitioners:** Jhace Torrins (primary), Chloen (versatile), others

**Capabilities:**
- Heal physical injuries: cuts, bruises, broken bones
- Stop bleeding
- Reduce pain
- Accelerate natural healing
- Works best on acute trauma (not chronic conditions)
- Can stabilize life-threatening injuries

**Limitations:**
- Cannot raise the dead
- Cannot cure diseases reliably
- Cannot heal self as effectively as others
- Cannot heal multiple people simultaneously (in N01)
- Effectiveness varies by injury severity and user exhaustion
- Some injuries resist healing (internal damage, complex trauma)

**How It Feels to User:**
- Warmth spreading from chest to hands
- Connection to injured person (empathic pull)
- Sensing damage as "wrongness" in the world
- Guiding healing "like coaxing a song"
- Exhaustion afterward (proportional to healing scale)

**How It Looks to Observer:**
- Soft golden glow around hands (subtle, not dramatic)
- Injured person relaxes; pain visibly eases
- Wounds close faster than natural
- User sweats, trembles slightly, shows exhaustion

---

### **Shaping (Precision-Type)**

**Practitioners:** Tiffani Merrow (primary), Chloen (versatile), craft workers

**Capabilities:**
- Shape materials with unprecedented precision: glass, metal, stone
- Repair marry-points perfectly
- Stabilize structures
- Create intricate geometric forms
- Works best on inorganic materials
- Can manipulate at microscopic scale (glass molecule alignment)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot affect living things directly
- Cannot work on massive scales (yet; limited to human-sized objects)
- Requires concentration and mental clarity
- Fails if user is distracted or exhausted
- Some materials resist (unknown why; iron is difficult)

**How It Feels to User:**
- Cool, crystalline clarity in mind
- Sensing structure as geometric patterns
- Guiding material into precise forms
- Mental precision required (visualization)
- Sharp, clean exhaustion afterward

**How It Looks to Observer:**
- Cool, blue-silver shimmer around hands
- Material responds as if alive (flowing, shifting)
- Geometric precision beyond manual skill
- User's eyes unfocus; intense concentration
- Finished work is unnaturally perfect

---

### **Preservation (Variant Precision-Type)**

**Practitioners:** Mobel Kress (primary), preservation specialists

**Capabilities:**
- Preserve food from decay
- Stabilize water purity
- Maintain structural integrity over time
- Prevent rot, rust, degradation
- Works on organic and inorganic materials

**Limitations:**
- Cannot reverse decay (only prevent)
- Requires sustained concentration
- Effect fades over time (must be renewed)
- Large-scale preservation exhausts quickly

**How It Feels to User:**
- Sensing decay as wrongness
- "Holding things intact" mentally
- Coolness and numbness (not warmth like healing)
- Isolation sensation (disconnect from surroundings)

**How It Looks to Observer:**
- Subtle; often invisible
- Preserved items don't decay as expected
- User becomes more withdrawn, quiet

## Part 2: Physical Costs (N01 Baseline)

### **Jhace's Costs (Vein-Burn Pattern)**

**Progression Across N01:**
- **Ch 3:** Vein-burn appears after scaffold healing; angry red disc on left forearm (~1.5 cm diameter)
- **Ch 5:** Burn expands to ~2.0 cm; pain increases with each use; left hand tremor begins
- **Ch 8:** Burn at ~2.5 cm; tremor worsens; warmth feels harder to summon
- **Ch 11:** Deep exhaustion compounds; pain constant even at rest
- **Ch 14:** Burn reaches ~2.5 cm (stable); tremor permanent; acceptance

**Physical Symptoms:**
- Burn mark: red to dark copper color; warm to touch; throbs during use
- Tremor: left hand; subtle at first, worsening with overuse
- Exhaustion: proportional to healing scale; deep, bone-tired
- Warmth depletion: feels "empty" after large workings; takes time to recover

**Psychological Impact:**
- Fear of becoming like Soress (visible costs terrify)
- Guilt when refusing to heal (can't help everyone)
- Identity crisis: "Am I a healer or a weapon?"

---

### **Tiffani's Costs (Calcification Pattern)**

**Progression Across N01:**
- **Ch 4:** Joint stiffness begins; fingers slow to flex in morning
- **Ch 6:** Stiffness increases; pain during fine work; hands slower
- **Ch 9:** Visible reduction in range of motion; coolness in fingertips
- **Ch 12:** Mental exhaustion compounds physical; concentration harder
- **Ch 14:** Significant stiffness; pain constant; accepts imperfection

**Physical Symptoms:**
- Joint stiffness: hands especially; fingers feel "locked"
- Pain: sharp when moving; ache at rest
- Coolness: fingertips feel cold even in warm rooms
- Reduced dexterity: precision work takes longer, hurts more

**Psychological Impact:**
- Fear of losing craft identity (hands are her skill)
- Perfectionism intensifies (must prove she's still capable)
- Isolation: doesn't want others to see weakness

---

### **Mobel's Costs (Isolation Pattern)**

**Progression Across N01:**
- **Ch 2:** Early numbness; prefers quiet
- **Ch 5:** Avoids crowds; complains of "too much noise"
- **Ch 8:** Isolation deepens; sensory sensitivity increases
- **Ch 11:** Rarely leaves home; touch feels "wrong"
- **Ch 14:** Present but barely speaks; clearly suffering

**Physical Symptoms:**
- Numbness: emotional and physical; difficulty feeling touch
- Sensory sensitivity: sounds too loud, light too bright, touch painful
- Social withdrawal: can't tolerate proximity
- Emotional flattening: difficulty expressing or feeling emotions

**Psychological Impact:**
- Loneliness: wants connection but can't tolerate it
- Confusion: doesn't understand what's happening
- Fear: am I losing my humanity?

### **Venn's Costs (Vitality Drain Pattern)**

**Progression Across N01:**
- **Ch 1:** Subtle fatigue; needs more rest
- **Ch 4:** Looking older; hair graying faster
- **Ch 7:** Constant fatigue; reduced energy
- **Ch 10:** Visibly aged; moves slower
- **Ch 14:** Exhausted but present; philosophical acceptance

**Physical Symptoms:**
- Accelerated aging appearance: gray hair, lines, weathered skin
- Constant fatigue: even after rest
- Vitality drain: life force depleting
- Slower movement: not injury, just weariness

**Psychological Impact:**
- Philosophical about mortality
- Urgency to pass on wisdom
- Acceptance mixed with regret

## Part 3: Failure Modes

### **Overuse Exhaustion**

**Trigger:** Using magic beyond capacity

**Symptoms:**
- Severe exhaustion; cannot stand
- Magic stops working temporarily
- Physical collapse
- Pain at cost sites (vein-burn, joints)
- Takes days to recover

**Example:** Jhace after scaffold incident (Ch 3); Tiffani after marathon shaping session (Ch 6)

---

### **Cascade Failure**

**Trigger:** Pushing magic while exhausted or in pain

**Symptoms:**
- Magic turns on user
- Feedback loop of pain
- Damage to self (burns worsen, joints seize)
- Temporary inability to use magic
- Fear response; psychological trauma

**Example:** Soress Tike's public collapse (Ch 10)

---

### **Resistance / Wrongness**

**Trigger:** Attempting to heal/shape something that resists

**Symptoms:**
- Magic feels "wrong"
- Material or injury pushes back
- User feels nausea, disorientation
- Attempt fails despite effort
- Leaves user shaken

**Example:** Jhace attempting to heal Bram (backstory); Tiffani shaping iron (Ch 9 failure)

---

### **Social Consequences**

**Trigger:** Magic use witnessed by community

**Symptoms:**
- Judgment, fear, awe (mixed reactions)
- Pressure to use magic for others
- Ostracism if reckless
- Expectations exceed capacity

**Example:** Community response to Jhace healing Nael (Ch 3); Soress Tike ostracized (Ch 10)

- Relaxation; trust

---

### **Precision-Type Magic (Shaping)**

**Visual:**
- Cool blue-silver shimmer around hands
- Material glows faintly at manipulation point
- Geometric patterns briefly visible (like frost crystals)

**Auditory:**
- High chime (glass-like, delicate)

- Cool clarity in mind
- Mental geometry visualization
- Fingertips feel cold
- Sharp, clean exhaustion afterward

**Tactile (Material):**
- Responds as if alive
- Flows, shifts, settles
- Cools after manipulation

---

### **Preservation-Type Magic**

**Visual:**
- Almost invisible
- Faint shimmer if observed closely
- Absence of decay (negative space effect)

**Auditory:**
- Silence; absence of rot sounds
- Eerie stillness

**Tactile (User):**
- Numbness
- Disconnection from surroundings

## Part 5: Knowledge Ceiling (What Characters Know vs. Don't Know)

### **What Characters Know by End of N01:**

✓ Magic exists; awakened post-Piercing
✓ Instinctive, miraculous, unpredictable
✓ Different people have different abilities
✓ Costs exist: pain, exhaustion, burns, tremors, stiffness, isolation
✓ Overuse is dangerous
✓ Some things can't be healed/shaped
✓ Failure modes exist (exhaustion, cascade, resistance)
✓ Social consequences are real

### **What Characters DO NOT Know (Forbidden in N01):**

✗ Four Principles framework
✗ Technical terms: resonance, frequency, veins, Hollowing, Confluence
✗ Why magic differs between people
✗ Systematic cost mechanics
✗ How to prevent or minimize costs
✗ Formal limits or safe-use guidelines
✗ Faction affiliations based on magic type
✗ God-vessel transformations
✗ Dual-principle potential
✗ Any systematic theory

## Part 6: Magic Use Guidelines (For Writers)

### **Every Working Must Show Cost**

**Micro Workings (2-3 breaths):**
- Minor exhaustion
- Brief warmth/coolness
- No visible damage yet

**Standard Workings (4-8 breaths):**
- Moderate exhaustion
- Cost site pain (burn throbs, joints ache)
- Visible strain

**Grand Workings (9-12+ breaths):**
- Severe exhaustion
- Cost progression (burn expands, tremor worsens)
- Risk of cascade failure

**Example Ratios:**
- **Healing a cut:** Micro working; minor exhaustion
- **Healing broken bone:** Standard working; cost site pain, fatigue
- **Healing multiple injuries or life-threatening trauma:** Grand working; vein-burn expands, tremor worsens, collapse risk

---

### **Sensory Language Checklist**

**Safe Terms:**
- Magic, gift, ability, power
- Warmth, coolness, tingling, pulling
- Instinctive, miraculous, unpredictable
- Exhaustion, pain, tremor, stiffness

**Forbidden Terms:**
- Resonance (technical)
- Principles, affinities, frequencies
- Veins, vein network
- Hollowing, Confluence, echo stacking
- Suppression, dampening
- Faction names (capitalized)

---

### **Failure and Resistance**

**Not Everything Should Succeed:**
- Magic is unpredictable in N01
- Failures create drama and stakes
- Resistance teaches limits
- Overconfidence is punished

**When to Show Failure:**
- When stakes are highest (dramatic timing)
- When user is exhausted or overconfident
- When injury/material resists for unknown reasons
- When cost has accumulated too much

## Summary

N01 magic is **instinctive, costly, and mysterious**. Characters experience power but don't understand it. Every use has consequences. Failure is common. The journey from wonder to caution defines the novella's emotional arc.

**Writer's Mantra for N01 Magic:**
- Show, don't explain
- Cost is always visible
- Failure teaches limits
- Mystery creates tension

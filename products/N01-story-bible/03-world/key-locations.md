## Primary Locations

### **Coreven—Underface (Forge District)**

**Overview:**
Industrial heart of Coreven city. Multi-level scaffold networks support residential and craft spaces. Heat-grid hum provides constant background percussion. Jhace's home territory.

**Sensory Profile:**

**Sights:**
- Scaffold networks crisscross overhead and underfoot
- Marry-points (glass-and-metal joints) catch light like prisms
- Heat-grid glow (copper-orange) visible through grate floors
- Forge smoke rises in pillars; soot stains everything
- Workers move in coordinated patterns (dance of labor)

**Sounds:**
- Hammer-on-metal percussion (rhythmic, industrial music)
- Heat-grid hum (low, constant, felt in chest)
- Scaffold creaks and groans under weight
- Voices echo off metal surfaces
- Steam vents hiss at intervals

**Smells:**
- Hot metal and soot (acrid, sharp, nostalgic)
- Forge coal burning (sulfurous undertone)
- Sweat and oil from workers
- Ozone smell when magic is used nearby

**Textures:**
- Metal surfaces warm to the touch (heat-grid proximity)
- Scaffold bars smooth from countless hands
- Grate floors vibrate with machinery below
- Soot grit on skin and clothing

**Cultural Significance:**
- Working-class identity; pride in craft
- Community defined by labor and mutual support
- Hierarchy based on skill, not birth
- Post-Piercing, magic use is increasing but controversial

**Dramatic Potential:**

**Good for:**
- Action scenes (scaffold collapses, rescues, physical danger)

- Jhace's internal moments (home territory, sensory comfort)
- Cost visibility (physical labor + magic strain)

**Key Locations Within Underface:**
- **Jhace's Workshop:** Small, cluttered, tools everywhere; smells of oil and sawdust

## Location Logistics

**Travel Times (Approximate):**
- Underface to Glassworks: 1 tide (half-day walk, or shorter via scaffold lifts)
- Underface to Council District: 1.5 tides (deliberately distant)
- Glassworks to Lattice Yards: 0.5 tide
- Anywhere to anywhere in emergency: 0.25–0.5 tide (shortcuts via scaffold)

**Vertical Structure:**
- **Upper Coreven:** Wealthy, clean, distant from heat-grid
- **Mid-Coreven:** Craft districts, markets, Council buildings (Glassworks here)
- **Underface:** Industrial, working-class, scaffold networks, heat-grid access (Jhace's territory)
- **Below:** Heat-grid machinery, maintenance tunnels, dangerous

**Weather Impact:**
- Wind affects scaffold stability
- Rain makes metal slippery
- Cold affects glass work (Tiffani's concern)
- Heat-grid provides baseline warmth even in winter

## Sensory FX: Magic in Locations

**Underface:**
- Jhace's warmth-magic: Golden glow reflects off metal surfaces; hum resonates with heat-grid
- Metal amplifies magic (for better or worse)
- Crowded spaces = witnesses = social consequences

**Glassworks:**
- Tiffani's precision-magic: Cool light refracts through glass; chime harmonics
- Glass responds to magic (vibrates, glows subtly)
- Quiet space = cost more noticeable (stiffness, pain audible)

**Lattice Yards:**
- Public magic: Spectacle; reactions vary (awe, fear, judgment)
- Open space = magic feels bigger, more visible
- Community judgment immediate

**Council District:**
- Magic feels wrong here (too clean, too controlled)
- Bureaucrats uncomfortable with visible power
- Class tension amplified

---

## Location-Specific Constraints

**Underface:**
- Scaffold collapses possible
- Heat-grid malfunctions dangerous
- Crowded; privacy difficult

**Glassworks:**
- Temperature-sensitive environment
- Glass shattering = costly and loud
- Tiffani's control territory; others are guests

**Lattice Yards:**
- Public; no secrets
- Weather-exposed
- Crowd dynamics unpredictable

**Council District:**
- Authority present; less freedom
- Social rules stricter
- Physical distance from craft reality

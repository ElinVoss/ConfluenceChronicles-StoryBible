## Thematic Through-Lines

### **Primary Theme: "The cost of holding what should be let go"**

- Jhace holds onto control, must learn to let go and accept help

- Magic: holding life/structure costs; letting go costs more

### **Secondary Themes**

- Tiffani's arc embodies this; perfectionism becomes prison
- Jhace's attempts to save everyone; can't be perfect healer

**"Confluence as terminal, not a toy":**
- Foreshadowed through Soress's recklessness
- Magic is dangerous; not to be used lightly
- Costs are real and permanent

## PART 1: BASIC OBSERVATIONS

### **What Is Soulpulse? (N01 Understanding)**

**Observable Phenomena:**
- Magic that responds to will and emotion
- Some people can heal injuries (like Jhace with the child)

- Some people can shape materials (Tiffani with glass)
- Each person's magic feels different

**Common Descriptions:**
- "The world sings along" when it works
- "Warm" vs. "cold" sensations
- Tingling, vibration, pulling feeling
- Material responding as if alive

**Physical Sensations:**
- Warmth spreading through chest/hands
- Tingling in extremities
- Pulling sensation toward target
- Exhaustion afterward
- Sometimes pain (mysterious burns, aches)

---

## PART 2: INSTINCTIVE HEALING (Jhace's Discovery)

### **How Jhace Heals (N01)**

**What It Feels Like:**
- Warmth spreading from chest to hands
- Connection to injured person
- Sensing damage as wrongness
- Guiding healing "like coaxing song"
- Exhaustion afterward

**What He Can Do:**
- Heal wounds (cuts, bruises, broken bones)
- Stop bleeding
- Reduce pain
- Accelerate natural healing
- Works better on simpler injuries

**What He Cannot Do:**
- Raise dead
- Cure diseases instantly
- Heal himself reliably
- Heal multiple people at once (yet)
- Understand how it works

**Physical Cost:**
- Exhaustion (proportional to healing size)
- Mysterious burn on forearm (from scaffolding save, Ch3)
- Tremor in left hand (from overuse)
- Warmth fading afterward (feeling depleted)

---

## PART 3: INSTINCTIVE SHAPING (Tiffani's Ability)

### **How Tiffani Shapes (N01)**

**What It Feels Like:**
- Cool, crystalline clarity
- Sensing structure as geometric patterns
- Guiding material into precise forms
- Mental precision required
- Different exhaustion than Jhace's (sharper, cleaner)

**What She Can Do:**
- Shape glass with unprecedented precision
- Repair marry points perfectly
- Stabilize structures
- Create intricate joints
- Works better on inorganic materials

**What She Cannot Do:**
- Heal living things
- Work on large scales (yet)
- Explain technical basis
- Teach others reliably

**Physical Cost:**
- Mental exhaustion (concentration drain)
- Joint stiffness (hands especially)
- Occasional tremors
- Coolness in extremities

---

## PART 4: OBSERVABLE DIFFERENCES

### **Jhace vs. Tiffani (N01 Observations)**

**Jhace's Magic:**
- Warmth-based
- Works on living things
- Intuitive, emotional
- Exhaustion afterward
- Burn scar from overuse

**Tiffani's Magic:**
- Coolness-based
- Works on structures
- Precision-based, mental
- Joint stiffness afterward
- No visible scars yet

**Speculation (Characters Don't Know):**
- Maybe magic responds to personality?
- Maybe different people have different "types"?
- Maybe training determines ability?
- No systematic understanding yet

---

## PART 5: PHYSICAL COSTS (N01 Knowledge)

### **Known Dangers:**

**Overuse:**
- Severe exhaustion
- Mysterious burns/marks
- Tremors
- Temporary inability to use magic
- Jhace's left hand tremor (permanent)
- Jhace's forearm burn scar (permanent)

**Uncertain Limits:**
- How much is too much? (Unknown)
- Can you die from overuse? (Suspected but unconfirmed)
- Are costs permanent? (Seems so for some)
- Can costs be healed? (Unclear)

**Warning Signs:**
- Extreme exhaustion
- Pain during use
- Trembling
- Coldness or excessive heat
- Difficulty maintaining focus

## PART 6: BRAM'S DEATH (N01 Trauma)

### **What Happened:**

**Jhace's Perspective:**
- Attempted to heal Bram (mentor, father-figure)
- Pushed too hard, too long
- Felt something wrong (resistance, wrongness)
- Couldn't save him
- Bram died despite Jhace's efforts

**Lesson Learned:**
- Magic has limits
- Some things can't be healed
- Overuse is dangerous
- Grief doesn't make magic stronger

**Lasting Impact:**
- Jhace more cautious with healing
- Fear of losing people he loves
- Awareness that magic isn't omnipotent
- Burn scar reminder of failure

---

## PART 7: CHLOEN'S DIFFERENCE (N01 Observation)

### **What's Unusual About Chloen:**

**Observable Facts:**
- Can use multiple types of magic
- Heals (like Jhace) AND shapes (like Tiffani)
- Younger, less experienced, but versatile
- Exhausts faster than specialists
- Seems to "bridge" different approaches

**Speculation:**
- Is this normal?
- Is she special?
- Will others develop versatility?
- Unknown

---

## PART 8: FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE (N01 Scope)

**Do NOT reference in N01 prose:**
- "Four Principles" or named principles
- "Resonance" as technical term
- "Veins" or "vein network"
- "Hollowing" as condition
- "Confluence" or multi-principle theory
- "Echo stacking"
- "Suppression devices"
- Faction names based on magic type
- God-vessel transformations
- Any systematic theory

**Instead use:**
- "Magic" or "the gift"
- "His ability" or "her power"
- "Different kinds of magic"

- Like guiding song

**Tiffani's Magic (Precision-Type):**

## PART 10: N01 CLOSING STATE

**By End of N01, Characters Know:**
- Magic exists, awakened by Piercing
- Different people have different abilities
- Healing and shaping are distinct
- Magic has physical cost
- Overuse is dangerous
- Some limits exist (can't raise dead)
- Chloen is unusually versatile

**By End of N01, Characters DO NOT Know:**
- Why magic differs between people
- Systematic principles
- Technical mechanics
- Formal limits or theories
- Whether faction-splits will occur
- Anything about god-vessels
- Future developments

**Tone:**
Discovery, wonder, caution, grief. Magic is miraculous but costly, hopeful but dangerous.

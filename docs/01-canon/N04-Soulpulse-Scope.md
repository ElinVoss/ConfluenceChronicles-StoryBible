## PART 1: HOLLOWING (Terminal Condition Identified)

### **What It Is:**

**Definition:**
Terminal condition where Soulpulse user's conviction fails catastrophically. Irreversible loss of resonance ability. Death of practitioner's connection to Soulpulse.

**Symptoms:**
- Tremors (severe, constant)
- Vein-deadening (ability fades, then vanishes)
- Vacant eyes (thousand-yard stare)
- Inability to spark resonance
- Neurological collapse
- Catatonic state (severe cases)

**Causes:**
- Exceeding safe capacity repeatedly
- Pushing past warning signs
- Conviction failure under extreme stress
- Combination of physical/psychological overload

**Progression:**
1. Warning signs (tremors, difficulty focusing)
2. Reduced capacity (resonance weakens)
3. Intermittent failure (ability comes and goes)
4. Total loss (permanent inability)
5. Catatonia (severe cases)

**Is It Reversible?**
No known cure. Once Hollowed, practitioner never regains ability. Some recover from catatonia, but resonance gone forever.

**Prevention:**
- Respect personal limits
- Don't push past warning signs
- Rest between major uses
- Accept that some things can't be done

### **Jhace's Near-Hollowing (N04 Ch2-3)**

**What Happened:**
- Overextended stabilizing geothermal conduit
- Pushed beyond safe capacity
- Severe neurological collapse
- Body shut down, wracked by tremors
- Internal vein-ruptures
- Vision blurred, hands shaking
- Refused to stop until forced
- Collapsed unconscious

**Symptoms:**
- All early Hollowing signs present
- Teetering on edge of terminal condition
- Would have Hollowed if continued
- Saved by Tiffani's intervention

**Recovery:**
- Tiffani used dual-principle healing
- Stabilized vein structure (Form) + healed ruptures (Wholeness)
- Impossible feat thought only Jhace capable of (instinctively)
- Jhace survived but learned harsh lesson

**Lesson Learned:**
- Ambition without caution kills
- Limits exist for reason
- Even "saving people" isn't worth Hollowing
- Sustainable practice only way forward

---

### **Corlexi's Hollowing (N04 Ch8-9)**

**Context:**
- Master architect, god-vessel in early awakening
- Attempted massive showcase construction
- Pushed apprentices beyond limits (two Hollowed mid-ritual)
- Attempted to salvage alone
- Even god-vessel's mortal body has limits

**His Hollowing:**
- Screamed as veins glowed then darkened
- Dropped to knees mid-feat
- Eyes vacant, body shaking
- Fell into catatonic state
- Giant shard crashed aside (couldn't hold)

**Aftermath:**
- Taken by healers
- Fate uncertain
- Myth of invincibility shattered
- Symbol of overreach's cost

**Significance:**
- Even most powerful practitioners can Hollow
- Ambition without limits leads to destruction
- Corlexi's failure taught whole city
- Hollowing epidemic halted by his example

---

## PART 2: DUAL-PRINCIPLE MASTERY (Tiffani's Revelation)

### **What Was Believed Before:**

**Single-Affinity Assumption:**
- Most practitioners have one resonance affinity
- Chloen's multi-affinity seen as rare anomaly
- Only Jhace thought capable of multiple principles (instinctively, during crisis)
- Deliberate multi-principle use thought impossible

**Why Dual-Principle Seemed Impossible:**
- Different frequencies clash (resonance friction)
- Mental focus can't split between contradictory approaches
- Physical cost of one affinity already severe
- Combining two would cause catastrophic failure

---

### **Tiffani's Demonstration (N04 Ch3)**

**Context:**
- Jhace dying from near-Hollowing
- No single-principle approach could save him
- Tiffani revealed hidden capability
- First public dual-principle use

**What She Did:**
- Channeled Form (Structural) to stabilize vein structure
- Simultaneously channeled Wholeness (Continuity) to heal ruptures
- Held both frequencies in perfect balance
- Saved Jhace's life

**How It Looked:**
- Blue-silver (Form) and copper-gold (Wholeness) glows simultaneously
- Geometric patterns overlaying organic healing
- Cool precision + warm flow at once
- Impossible combination working perfectly

**Reaction:**
- Witnesses shocked, awed
- Thought impossible just demonstrated
- Questions raised: Who else can do this?
- Implications: Multi-principle mastery trainable?

---

### **Tiffani's Partial Confession (N04 Ch5)**

**What She Revealed:**
- Trained by exceptional mentor before Piercing
- Learned dual-principle technique deliberately
- Cannot/will not fully explain
- Hints at hidden order or pre-Piercing knowledge

**What She Concealed:**
- Full extent of training
- Who her mentor was (Marisse connection suspected)
- Whether others have this knowledge
- Larger context of her abilities

**Jhace's Response:**
- Chooses trust despite mystery
- Accepts she has reasons for secrecy
- Loves her regardless of unanswered questions
- Relationship deepens through acceptance

**Physical Cost:**
- Dual-principle use accelerates vein-burn growth
- After saving Jhace: Tiffani's burn ~4.2 cm
- Slight tremor, pallor, exhaustion
- Calcification also worsened
- Strain visible but tolerable

---

## PART 3: FOUR PRINCIPLES (Beginning to Theorize)

### **Why Fourth Principle Now Recognized:**

**Observations:**
- Three factions established (Structural, Continuity, Purity)
- Releasers distinct but unclear relationship
- Tiffani's dual-principle demonstration
- Chloen's multi-affinity (deceased but remembered)
- Corlexi's god-vessel stirrings

**Theory Emerging:**
- Not three affinities—four fundamental principles
- Each principle represents aspect of reality
- Practitioners align with principle matching worldview
- Multi-principle mastery possible but rare

**Four Principles (Tentative Framework):**

1. **Form (Structural)**
   - Geometric order, precision, rigidity
   - Inorganic materials
   - Blue-silver, crystalline
   - Cost: Calcification

2. **Wholeness (Continuity)**
   - Connection, healing, flow
   - Organic materials and bonds
   - Copper-gold, warm
   - Cost: Vein-burn, identity bleed

3. **Purity (Sanctification)**
   - Separation, cleansing, judgment
   - Purification and burning
   - White-gold, piercing
   - Cost: Isolation, tissue swelling

4. **Entropy (Dissolution)**
   - Endings, decay, acceptance
   - Controlled release
   - Ash-gray, fading
   - Cost: Vitality drain, aging

**Not Yet Formalized:**
- No unified theory
- No systematic training framework
- No complete understanding of relationships
- Just beginning to see pattern

---

## PART 4: SAFE LIMITS ESTABLISHED

### **Post-Hollowing Guidelines:**

**Personal Limits:**
- Each practitioner has maximum safe capacity
- Varies by individual, affinity, training
- Warning signs must be respected
- Rest periods mandatory

**Warning Signs:**
- Tremors
- Difficulty focusing
- Unusual exhaustion
- Pain during use
- Resonance feeling forced
- Vision changes
- Neurological symptoms

**Recommended Practices:**
- Work within 70% of perceived maximum
- Rest after major uses
- Don't chain multiple large efforts
- Accept that some things can't be done
- Better to fail task than Hollow

**Institutional Changes (Post-Corlexi):**
- Prism imposes strict guidelines
- Guild councils establish standards
- Apprentices taught caution
- Hollowing epidemic halted

---

## PART 5: PHYSICAL COSTS (N04 Progression)

### **Vein-Burn (Continuity):**
- Jhace's burn: ~3.5 cm by N04 end
- Accelerated by near-Hollowing crisis
- Permanent tremor in left hand worsened
- Learns minor self-healing (reduces tremor slightly)

### **Calcification (Structural):**
- Tiffani's hands: noticeable reduction in range
- Dual-principle use worsened condition
- Blue-silver discoloration visible
- Pain during fine work constant
- Uses Soulpulse sparingly now

### **Isolation (Purity):**
- Mobel: extreme isolation, cannot tolerate touch
- Tissue swelling severe
- Emotional numbness total
- Approaching god-vessel transformation (unknowingly)

### **Vitality Drain (Entropy):**
- Venn: appears 10-15 years older than age
- Constant fatigue
- Physical weakness pronounced
- Philosophical acceptance complete
- Approaching god-vessel transformation (unknowingly)

---

## PART 6: INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS

### **Heat-Grid: ~90% Restored**

**What This Means:**
- No longer at risk of imminent collapse
- Daily maintenance manageable
- Natural disaster era ending
- Focus shifts to political conflicts

**Remaining Issues:**
- Some districts still struggling
- Factional territories unequal access
- Maintenance weaponized politically
- Lattice dust corrosion constant

---

## PART 7: GOD-VESSELS APPROACHING (N04 Observations)

### **Four Individuals:**

**Corlexi (Form):**
- Hollowed during showcase
- Catatonic, fate uncertain
- God-compulsion drove him to destruction
- Transformation approaching?

**Mobel (Purity):**
- Extreme isolation
- Physical body failing
- Religious zealotry intensifying
- Something stirring beyond human

**Salee (Wholeness):**
- Network connections deepening
- Sensing districts as extensions of self
- Invisible web of wholeness
- Approaching limits of mortal capacity

**Eries (Entropy):**
- Philosophy spreading rapidly
- Comfort with endings intensifying
- Garden responds to her presence
- Peaceful dissolution emanating

**Characters Don't Know:**
- These four will transform into gods
- Transformation imminent (months away)
- Connection between them
- Their future significance

---

## PART 8: FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE (N04 Scope)

**Do NOT reference in N04 prose:**
- "Confluence" (all four principles simultaneously)
- Suppression technology
- God-vessel transformations as known fact
- Systematic vein network theory
- Tiffani's full background/training
- Events of N05 (Steal Breaks Open, her death)

**Instead use:**
- "Four principles" as emerging theory (not formalized)
- "Dual-principle mastery" as rare capability
- "Hollowing" as named terminal condition
- God-vessels as individuals approaching something unknown
- Observations without complete understanding

---

## PART 9: N04 CLOSING STATE

**By End of N04, Characters Know:**
- Hollowing is terminal condition
- Dual-principle mastery possible (Tiffani demonstrated)
- Four principles emerging as framework
- Safe limits must be respected
- Infrastructure ~90% restored
- God-vessels approaching something

**By End of N04, Characters DO NOT Know:**
- Confluence (all four principles at once)
- Suppression technology exists
- God-vessel transformations imminent
- Tiffani will die saving Jhace (N05)
- Jhace will manifest Confluence through grief
- Complete vein network theory

**Tone:**
Limits learned through tragedy, secrets partially revealed, trust deepened despite mystery, hope cautious, awareness growing that larger changes approach.

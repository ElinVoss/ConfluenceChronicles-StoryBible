# Soulpulse Resonance System — Production Canon v1.0

**Purpose:** Lock final, production-ready rules for on-page use of Soulpulse across all books/episodes. This is the baseline for consistency, training new writers, and catching drift.

---

## 0) TL;DR — The Three-Line Rule
1) **It’s resonance, not force.** Effects arise by **attuning** the user’s pulse to the target’s natural frequency.
2) **Costs are mandatory and visible.** **Vein-burn → echo → fatigue/identity tax** track on-page. Hollowing is irreversible.
3) **Four principles, two axes, one paradox:** **Form ↔ Entropy**, **Purity ↔ Wholeness**. **Confluence** = all four at once; terminal for mortals.

---

## 1) Metaphysics
- **World substrate:** A planetary vein-network carries vibrational energy ("Soulpulse"). Every material/life-form has a **natural frequency** (NF).
- **User substrate:** A practitioner’s **soul-frequency** can be modulated via breath, intent, gesture, and tools to match a target’s NF (= **attunement**). 
- **Fields:** Use creates a **pulse-field** (PF) that propagates through local matter and interacts with other PFs (constructive/destructive interference). 
- **Opposition:** Invoking one principle automatically rouses resistance from its opposite. No stable “pure” state exists without a counterforce.

### The Four Principles (operational view)
- **Form (Structure):** impose/restore ideal geometry; reinforce, lock, crystallize; long-lived constructs that still decay over time.
- **Wholeness (Continuity):** knit, link, mend; empathic bridges; stabilize flows; limited cross-material bonding.
- **Purity (Cleansing):** separate, refine, excise; selective burn; judgment-directional and prone to collateral when over-driven.
- **Entropy (Dissolution):** release, end, soften bonds; accelerate decay; nullify constructs and soothe endings.

**Divine opposition pairs:** Form⇄Entropy, Purity⇄Wholeness.

## 2) Core Mechanics & Safe Ops

### 2.1 Attunement Protocol (single-user)
**Goal:** establish resonance match with the smallest harmful delta.
1) **Probe:** low-amplitude pulse pings; read tactile/auditory/empathic feedback.
2) **Trim:** micro-adjust breath tempo and focus; bring buzz → hum.
3) **Seat:** hold steady 2–8 breaths to stabilize.
4) **Work:** scale amplitude gradually while monitoring PF stability.
5) **Damp:** active cooldown (grounding, breath reset) to clear **vein-echo**.

*Failure heuristic:* push-through on mismatch = **dissonance → vein-burn → snap**.

### 2.2 Multi-Resonance / “Overtones”
- **Two-tone (dual):** rare, trainable in exceptional users; sharply increases strain. Treat as **hazard class Beta**.
- **Chord (3–4):** unstable; mortals cannot hold safely outside split-second flares.
- **Confluence (all four simultaneous):** **paradox engine.** Mortals: **terminal**. Gods: not achievable (each is a pure aspect). 

### 2.3 Pulse-Field Dynamics
- **Echo Stacking:** residual PF lingers after use; back-to-back workings amplify error. Writers must include either **wait** or **damp** step.
- **Resonance Cascade:** uncontrolled propagation via substrate (structures/veins) causing chain failures, quakes, or collapses.
- **Team Interference:** uncoordinated PFs create feedback. **Stagger** or **choir** (see §2.4) to avoid.

### 2.4 Group Work — Choir & Ring Patterns
- **Duo Harmonic:** lead sets NF; partner rides the overtone. Use for complex repairs or combat shielding.
- **Fivefold Choir (healing):** staggered entries, overlapping 2-breath windows; one **breaker** assigned to cut links on overload.
- **Structural Ring (8–12):** equidistant placement; rotate leads every 3–5 breaths; **anchor** maintains phase clock.

## 3) Costs, Injuries, and Failure Modes

### 3.1 Mandatory Costs (choose ≥1 per working on-page)
- **Physio:** tremor, after-heat, joint stiffness (principle-specific manifestations).
- **Psycho:** empathy bleed (Wholeness), perfection fixation (Form), zealotry/isolation (Purity), fatigue/nihilism (Entropy).
- **Systemic:** rising **vein-burn** level; visible channel glow/scar progression.

### 3.2 Progressive Injury Ladder
1) **After-heat / sting** → rest resolves.
2) **Vein-burn** (micro-tears, glow) → requires cooldown & care.
3) **Vein-snap** (channel rupture) → collapse, localized loss of function.
4) **Hollowing** (conviction failure; resonance goes dark) → **irreversible**.

### 3.3 Link-Specific Hazards
- **Sympathetic Overload:** healer shares target’s pain/trauma; requires **breaker**.
- **Identity Bleed:** blurred self/other after repeated Wholeness.
- **Over-Purity:** auto-immolating burn; collateral via over-selection.
- **Over-Form:** calcification/ossification; cognitive rigidity.
- **Over-Entropy:** dissociation, premature aging signatures.

## 4) Combat & Field Applications

### 4.1 Techniques (legal for protagonists)
- **Tethering:** latch onto opponent NF to damp/enhance. High-risk; establish cutout.
- **Null Pulse (Entropy):** quick dissolve of enemy constructs or ongoing PFs.
- **Lattice Salves:** prep items that resonate on activation as low-amplitude aids.
- **Pop-up Forts (Form):** short-duration girders/plates; require renewal; expect Purity/Entropy counters.
- **Choir Shields (Wholeness):** rotating duty; explicit strain tracking.

### 4.2 Counters & Anti-magic
- **Suppression Fields:** dissonant blankets that jam PFs; risk of systemic **Cascade** if scaled wide on stressed networks.
- **On-page response:** narrow bandwidth, local dampers, or **go silent** (no PF) until field cycles.

---

## 5) Quantitative Dials (for scene design)
- **Pulse classes:** Micro (tool aid) / Standard (scene beat) / Grand (set-piece). 
- **Breath economy:** Most safe workings resolve in **2–8 breaths**. Anything >12 breaths must show multiple costs.
- **Cooldown:** Minimum **1–3 breaths** quiet after micro; **dozens** after grand; choir requires rotation.
- **Range:** Direct-contact is safest; line-of-sight possible with increased error; long-range via substrates invites Cascade.

## 6) Canon-by-Principle (writer crib)

### Form
- **Essence:** order/geometry/reinforcement. 
- **Signatures:** crystalline hum, blue-silver glow, rigidity metaphors.
- **Costs:** stiffness, calcification, rule-obsession. 
- **Antagonisms:** undone by Entropy pulses; brittle under Purity over-selection.

### Wholeness
- **Essence:** mending/linking/stabilizing flows.
- **Signatures:** warm hum, copper-gold light, shared sensation.
- **Costs:** fatigue, identity bleed, sympathetic overload risk.
- **Antagonisms:** severed by Purity; destabilized by heavy Form reconfiguration.

### Purity
- **Essence:** excision/refinement/absolution.
- **Signatures:** white glare, selective burn, narrowing focus.
- **Costs:** inflammation, isolation, zeal escalation; risk auto-immolation at extremes.
- **Antagonisms:** blunted by Wholeness links; rigid Form traps can redirect Purity blasts.

### Entropy
- **Essence:** release/ending/softening bonds.
- **Signatures:** gray hush, wither/flake, easing.
- **Costs:** vitality drain, chill, melancholy, detachment.
- **Antagonisms:** resisted by fresh Form reinforcements; Purity can “burn through” rot if absolutely directed.

---

## 7) Confluence & Endgame Constraints
- **Definition:** full simultaneous resonance of all four principles.
- **Rules:**
  - Mortals: **terminal** (veins calcify/burn out; self-sacrificial window only).
  - Gods: **cannot** Confluence (each is a pure aspect, not a chord).
  - **Stasis constructs** created by Confluence (e.g., fivefold cages) trap; kills require **external teams**.
- **On-page:** display escalating **vein-burn clock**, sensory overload, and macro-environmental hum at distance.

---

## 8) Scene Execution Checklist (drop-in)
**Before:**
- Establish target NF cues (sound/texture/heat/feel). 
- Name principle(s) intended. 
- Define success state and **one** hard limit.

**During:**
- Show probe → trim → seat → work. 
- Log costs (physio/psycho/systemic). 
- Manage echo (pause/damp) or choir rotation.

**After:**
- Show world “ringing” or settling. 
- Update **vein-burn meter** for the user. 
- If group, name the **breaker** status.

---

## 9) Exploit Prevention & Edge Cases
- **No free heals:** Wholeness always trades something (time, pain, fatigue, identity tax).
- **No infinite walls:** Form constructs require renewal; entropy gnaws; Purity and Entropy have clean counters.
- **Purity selectivity cap:** cannot excise beyond user’s discrimination bandwidth; stress widens the cut and raises collateral.
- **Entropy precision:** small, surgical dissolves require calm and practice; panic spreads the rot.
- **Echo discipline:** stacking different principles without damp multiplies dissonance; order your chord deliberately.

---

## 10) Glossary (ops terms)
- **Attunement:** matching one’s pulse to target NF.
- **Pulse-Field (PF):** temporary resonance aura created by use.
- **Vein-echo:** residual vibration in user/environment post-use.
- **Dissonance:** mismatch between pulses → pain/damage/chaos.
- **Vein-burn / Vein-snap:** graded channel injuries (scar vs rupture).
- **Hollowing:** catastrophic conviction failure; permanent.
- **Overtone:** secondary principle layered atop the primary.
- **Breaker:** teammate assigned to sever dangerous links.
- **Choir/Ring:** coordinated group patterns for healing/structure.
- **Tethering:** latching onto another’s NF to modulate it.

---

## 11) Writer Notes & Style
- Use in-world craft verbs: **true, seat, brace, purge, knit, release**. Avoid “cast spell.”
- Track **breaths** and **burn** like stamina bars; make costs legible.
- Echo the **domain aesthetics** in sensory description (geometry/white fire/gold warmth/gray hush).

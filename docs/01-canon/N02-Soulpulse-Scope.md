## PART 1: THREE RESONANCE AFFINITIES

### **Purity Affinity (Sanctification)**

**Practitioners:** Mobel, temple keepers, isolationists
**Observable Characteristics:**
- Piercing, clear tone

**Personality Correlation (Observed):**
- Tends toward absolutism, judgment
- Values purity, separation
- Intolerant of compromise
- Increasing isolation

---

## PART 2: RESONANCE MECHANICS (N02 Understanding)

### **Frequency Matching**

**Basic Principle:**
- Every material has natural frequency
- Practitioner attunes their "pulse" to match
- When frequencies align: sympathetic resonance
- Reality shifts smoothly in response

**How It Works (Observable):**
1. Practitioner focuses on target
2. Senses target's frequency (intuitive)
3. Adjusts internal frequency to match
4. Resonance occurs (tingling, warmth/coolness)
5. Change happens
6. Cost paid (exhaustion, pain, marks)

**Resonance Friction:**
- When frequencies clash instead of matching
- Feels like grinding, resistance
- Causes pain, heat, damage
- Can lead to catastrophic failures

---

### **Catastrophic Failure Modes (N02 Discoveries)**

**Vein-Snap:**
- Material's internal structure breaks under strain
- Sudden, explosive failure
- Can kill bystanders
- Visible as cracks forming instantly
- Caused by excessive force or mismatched frequency

**Resonance Cascade:**
- Failure spreads through connected systems
- One marry point fails → adjacent fail → chain reaction
- Can collapse entire districts
- Visible as wave of failures
- Stopped by breaking connections

**Sympathetic Overload:**
- Practitioner absorbs too much from target
- Identity bleed taken to extreme
- Can lose sense of self
- Jhace experienced this (N02, near-death)
- Leaves lasting damage (tremors, scars)

---

## PART 3: PHYSICAL COSTS (N02 Systematized)

### **Vein-Burn (Continuity Users)**

**What It Is:**
- Mysterious marks appearing on skin
- Copper-gold discoloration
- Grows with repeated use
- Warm to touch
- Slight pain when using Soulpulse

**Progression:**
- Starts small (forearm, hands)
- Spreads slowly over months/years
- Unknown if it stops or kills
- Jhace's burn: ~2.5 cm by N02 end
- Causes: overuse, sympathetic overload

---

### **Calcification (Structural Users)**

**What It Is:**
- Joints slowly hardening
- Reduced flexibility over time
- Hands most affected
- Painful movement
- Blue-silver discoloration (subtle)

**Progression:**
- Starts with stiffness
- Progresses to reduced range of motion
- Unknown if it becomes total
- Tiffani's hands: noticeable stiffness by N02 end
- Causes: high-frequency resonance work

---

### **Isolation Tendency (Purity Users)**

**What It Is:**
- Emotional numbness
- Difficulty connecting with others
- Increasing need for solitude
- Physical sensitivity to touch
- Tissue swelling (hands, joints)

**Progression:**
- Starts with preference for solitude
- Becomes difficulty tolerating company
- Unknown if reversible
- Mobel: increasingly isolated by N02 end
- Causes: separation-based resonance

---

## PART 4: GUILD FRACTURE & FACTIONS

### **Three Emerging Factions (N02)**

**1. Structuralists ("The Rigid")**
- Led by: Forge-guild members, Kylar
- Philosophy: Order through precision, safety through regulation
- Methods: Guild structure, apprenticeships, standards
- Resonance: Structural affinity
- Growing toward: Licensing, control, exclusion

**2. Continuists ("The Bleeders")**
- Led by: Medical practitioners, Jhace's network (informal)
- Philosophy: Connection over control, healing focus
- Methods: Mutual aid, open knowledge-sharing
- Resonance: Continuity affinity
- Growing toward: Community organizing, resistance to regulation

**3. Separatists/Purists (No formal name yet)**
- Led by: Temple keepers, Mobel
- Philosophy: Purity requires separation, magic is sacred
- Methods: Isolation, strict standards, withdrawal
- Resonance: Purity affinity
- Growing toward: Extremism, judgment, exclusion

## PART 7: FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE (N02 Scope)

**Do NOT reference in N02 prose:**
- "Four Principles" (only three recognized)
- Entropy/Dissolution as formal principle
- Hollowing as named terminal condition
- Dual-principle mastery (Tiffani's secret)
- Confluence theory
- Suppression devices
- God-vessel transformations
- Systematic vein theory (suspected but not formalized)

**Instead use:**
- "Three resonance affinities" or "three types"
- "Sympathetic overload" for what becomes Hollowing
- Describe Chloen's multi-affinity as unusual, unexplained
- "Resonance friction" for dissonance
- Personal observations and faction-specific terminology

- Faction philosophies forming

**By End of N02, Characters DO NOT Know:**
- Fourth principle (Entropy)

**Tone:**
Systematization beginning, fear growing, factions hardening, costs becoming clear, wonder giving way to caution.

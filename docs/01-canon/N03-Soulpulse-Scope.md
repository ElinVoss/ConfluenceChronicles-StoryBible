## PART 1: THREE FACTIONS (Fully Crystallized)

### **Structuralists ("The Rigid")**

**Leadership:** Kylar (forge-guild origin, Structural Resonator)
**Philosophy:** Order through regulation; power must be organized; licensing required
**Territory:** Industrial districts, forge-quarters, heat-grid control stations
**Methods:** Bureaucracy, licensing enforcement, territorial exclusion
**Visual Identity:** Blue-silver sashes, geometric insignia
**Membership:** ~35% of practitioners (largest faction)

**Resonance Doctrine:**
- Only licensed practitioners permitted
- Structural work requires certification
- Unlicensed use is illegal in their territory
- Safety through control

**Combat Capabilities:**
- Collapse structures remotely
- Create instant barriers
- Lock opponents in geometric prisons
- Shatter weapons/materials
- Territorial advantage (control infrastructure)

---

### **Continuists ("The Bleeders")**

**Leadership:** Decentralized council; Jhace/Tiffani seen as symbolic figures (unwillingly)
**Philosophy:** Collaboration over control; open access to knowledge; healing-focused
**Territory:** Medical districts, residential areas, refugee settlements
**Methods:** Community organizing, mutual aid, consensus decision-making
**Visual Identity:** Copper-gold armbands (optional, not enforced)
**Membership:** ~40% of practitioners (largest but least organized)

**Resonance Doctrine:**
- Open practice (no licensing)
- Knowledge shared freely
- Anyone may attempt Soulpulse regardless of training
- Healing prioritized over control

**Combat Capabilities:**
- Heal allies mid-battle
- Disrupt enemy connections (painful)
- Sever bonds to disable opponents
- Maintain infrastructure during conflict
- Endurance/self-healing advantage

---

### **Releasers ("The Enders")**

**Leadership:** Venn (glass-guild origin, Dissolution Resonator)
**Philosophy:** Everything ends; we make endings gentle; acceptance over resistance
**Territory:** Burial grounds, waste processing, quarantine zones
**Methods:** Strategic withdrawal, controlled decay, pain management
**Visual Identity:** Ash-gray veils (worn during work)
**Membership:** ~15% of practitioners (smallest but strategically essential)

**Resonance Doctrine:**
- Quiet work (discreet use)
- Endings happen privately
- No loud demonstrations
- Acceptance of inevitable decay

**Combat Capabilities (Emerging Recognition):**
- Accelerate decay in structures/materials
- Peaceful death (mercy killing)
- Controlled dissolution of threats
- Strategic retreat advantage
- Essential services = leverage

**Fourth Principle Recognition:**
- Releasers practice what will become "Entropy principle"
- Not yet formally recognized as fourth principle
- Seen as extension of Purity by some, distinct by others
- Philosophical differences from other three affinities clear

---

## PART 2: RESONANCE WEAPONIZATION

### **Structural Warfare**

**Offensive Techniques:**
- **Collapse Strike:** Remotely destabilize building/structure
- **Barrier Generation:** Instant geometric walls

---

### **Continuity Warfare**

**Offensive Techniques:**
- **Bond Severing:** Disconnect components (painful, disabling)
- **Vein Disruption:** Interfere with opponent's Soulpulse
- **Connection Overload:** Force sympathetic overload on enemy
- **Network Collapse:** Fail multiple connections simultaneously
- **Identity Bleed Attack:** Force empathic overload (psychological)

**Defensive Techniques:**
- **Rapid Healing:** Mend wounds mid-combat
- **Network Stabilization:** Maintain allies' connections
- **Endurance Boost:** Sustain through continuous use
- **Self-Repair:** Heal self (limited, exhausting)

**Cost in Combat:**
- Vein-burn growth accelerates
- Identity bleed risk increases
- Sympathetic overload more likely
- Exhaustion cumulative, severe

---

### **Purity Warfare**

**Offensive Techniques:**
- **Purging Flame:** Burn "impurities" (including people)
- **Sterile Zone:** Create hostile environment (burns organics)

- **Isolation Field:** Force opponents apart (breaks formations)
- **Cleansing Wave:** Mass purge attack (indiscriminate)

**Defensive Techniques:**
- **Purity Shield:** Block "contaminated" attacks
- **Self-Purification:** Remove toxins, poisons instantly
- **Isolation Bubble:** Protect self through separation
- **Sanctification:** Make area inhospitable to enemies

**Cost in Combat:**
- Tissue swelling worsens rapidly
- Emotional numbness intensifies

- Isolation tendency becomes pathological

---

### **Releaser Warfare (Emerging)**

**Offensive Techniques:**
- **Decay Acceleration:** Rot structures, materials, flesh
- **Peaceful Release:** Mercy kill (painless, quiet)
- **Controlled Dissolution:** Targeted disintegration
- **Entropy Wave:** Area decay effect (slow but unstoppable)
- **Acceptance Aura:** Psychological attack (induces surrender)

**Defensive Techniques:**
- **Strategic Retreat:** Dissolve obstacles while fleeing
- **Pain Management:** Reduce suffering (self and allies)
- **Controlled Decay:** Safely collapse structures behind them
- **Acceptance:** Endure without fighting (philosophical strength)

**Cost in Combat:**
- Vitality drain (aging effect)
- Fatalism intensifies
- Physical weakness accumulates
- Existential exhaustion

---

## PART 3: LATTICE DUST (Environmental Hazard)

### **What It Is:**

**Composition:**
- Crystallized Soulpulse residue
- Permanent aftermath of Piercing
- Settles everywhere, especially near vein damage
- Mildly corrosive to materials
- Responds to active Soulpulse use

**Effects:**
- **Passive:** Slow corrosion of metal, stone, organic matter
- **Active:** Glows when Soulpulse used nearby
- **Weaponized:** Can be ignited/detonated by Purity users
- **Tracking:** Shows where Soulpulse has been used recently

**Mitigation:**
- Regular cleaning required
- Some areas more saturated than others
- No permanent removal method known
- Becomes environmental fact of life

**Factional Use:**
- Structuralists: Study it, try to contain it
- Continuists: Adapt to it, work around it
- Releasers: Accept it as sign of decay

---

## PART 4: SHADOW GRID NETWORKS

### **What They Are:**

**Definition:**
Underground system of cross-factional cooperation. Workers from all three factions (and independents) collaborate secretly on critical infrastructure, medical care, food distribution. Illegal in Structuralist territory; tolerated elsewhere.

**Operation:**
- Nighttime repairs without permission
- Cross-border medical aid
- Shared knowledge networks
- Mutual aid despite factional divisions

**Jhace/Tiffani's Role:**
- Central coordinators (unwillingly symbolic)
- Connect practitioners across factions
- Prioritize work over politics
- Refuse formal leadership but effectively lead

**Risks:**
- Arrest in Structuralist territory
- Faction retaliation
- Targeted violence (Chloen's death)
- Constant danger

---

## PART 5: CONVERGENCE POINTS

### **Definition:**
Physical locations where factional borders meet. Heavily monitored, tense, but necessary for trade/communication. Jhace/Tiffani use these for network coordination.

**Characteristics:**
- Neutral ground (theoretically)
- All factions patrol
- Violence common
- Essential for cross-border work

**Typical Features:**
- Checkpoint architecture
- Multiple faction guards
- Tense atmosphere
- Quick exits necessary

---

## PART 6: UPDATED PHYSICAL COSTS (N03 Progression)

### **Vein-Burn (Continuity):**
- Jhace's burn: ~3.0 cm by N03 end
- Spreading slowly but steadily
- Warm to touch, slight pain
- Unknown endpoint
- Chloen had multiple small burns (died before progression)

### **Calcification (Structural):**
- Tiffani's hands: noticeable stiffness, reduced range
- Blue-silver discoloration visible
- Pain during fine work
- Progression concerning but not disabling yet

### **Isolation (Purity):**
- Mobel: severely isolated, difficulty with human contact
- Tissue swelling in hands, joints
- Emotional numbness pronounced
- Physical sensitivity extreme

### **Vitality Drain (Releaser/Entropy):**
- Venn: appears older than chronological age
- Fatigue constant
- Philosophical acceptance growing
- Physical weakness accumulating

---

## PART 7: CHLOEN'S MULTI-AFFINITY (Unexplained)

### **Observations:**

**What She Could Do:**
- Heal (Continuity)
- Shape (Structural)
- Possibly others (undeveloped)

**Why Unusual:**
- Most practitioners have single affinity
- Multi-affinity exhausts faster
- Versatility vs. specialization trade-off
- No explanation for why she could

**Her Death:**
- Killed in warehouse massacre (Ch6)
- Didn't get to develop fully
- Mystery of multi-affinity remains
- Jhace suspects others might develop it (including himself, unknowingly)

---

## PART 8: FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE (N03 Scope)

**Do NOT reference in N03 prose:**
- "Four Principles" as formal framework (three factions + Releasers observed, but not theorized as four-principle system)
- "Hollowing" as named terminal condition
- Tiffani's dual-principle mastery (secret)
- Confluence theory
- Suppression technology
- God-vessel transformations
- Systematic vein network theory

**Instead use:**
- "Three factions" and "Releasers" (fourth group, distinct philosophy)
- "Resonance burnout" or "sympathetic overload" for what becomes Hollowing
- "Unusual versatility" for Chloen's multi-affinity
- Factional terminology and slang
- Personal observations, political language

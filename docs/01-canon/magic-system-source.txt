Soulpulse Resonance Magic System (Confluence Chronicles)
Metaphysical Foundations of Soulpulse
Vibrational Resonance Energy: Soulpulse is the innate magic of Te’Oga, operating on principles of resonance and vibration rather than brute force. It flows through an invisible planetary vein-network like currents in a living organism[1][2]. Every structure, element, and living being has a natural frequency – a unique vibrational signature – and each practitioner’s soul has its own “pulse” frequency[3][4]. Magic occurs not by imposing will, but by matching frequencies: when a Soulpulse user attunes their inner vibration to an external target’s frequency, a sympathetic resonance arises and reality shifts smoothly in response[5][6]. This is why early users described it not as commanding matter, but “coaxing the world to sing along” – a poetic truth that hides a rigorous principle.
Resonance Friction and Vein-Burn: If the frequencies clash instead of harmonizing, the result is resonance friction – the magical equivalent of grinding gears. In practical terms, failed Soulpulse attempts produce dissonance: harsh vibrational clashes that can shatter materials, backfire on the user, and scorch their internal “veins”[7]. Practitioners experience this as vein-burn, an internal burning pain and damage to their channels. For example, in the first known Soulpulse usage, Jhace Torrins desperately attuned to metal and flesh to save a friend; he succeeded, but his forearm veins glowed copper-gold and burned from within as mismatched resonance energy seared him[8]. Vein-burn is the heat of friction between soul-frequency and world-frequency – a literal cost paid in pain and injury when one’s will “rubs raw” against reality. Over time, repeated minor vein-burn accumulates as scars or tremors, while severe dissonance can cripple a practitioner on the spot.
Divine Opposition of Principles: At the heart of Soulpulse theory are four fundamental resonance principles that seem to underlie all magical effects: Form, Purity, Wholeness, and Entropy. These can be thought of as four great musical tones or cosmic currents, each with a distinct nature and intrinsically opposed counterpart. Form (structure/order) stands opposite to Entropy (dissolution/ending), while Purity (cleansing/separation) stands opposite to Wholeness (healing/connection). Metaphysically, each principle generates a unique “field” of influence and a set of frequencies, and when one principle is invoked, its opposite resists like a countermelody. This divine opposition means no creation of perfect order can occur without stirring entropy, and no act of total inclusion can occur without provoking some force of exclusion. Practically, a Soulpulse user aligned strongly to one principle finds it hardest to wield or withstand its opposite – an important limitation built into the magic’s fabric.
Pulse-Field Dynamics: Using Soulpulse creates a pulse-field, a vibrational aura that extends beyond the body into nearby matter and even other practitioners. These fields interact in complex ways. When harmonized (e.g. two healers working together in sync), they amplify each other, producing effects far greater than either could alone[9]. When disparate frequencies collide, they create interference or outright feedback loops. Unintended feedback can lead to a Resonance Cascade, where energy jumps unpredictably through the environment: one poorly tuned pulse might trigger vibrations in adjacent structures or in the planetary veins underfoot, causing chain reactions like collapsing buildings or “pulse-quakes” in the land[10]. The planet’s vein-network itself carries large-scale pulse-fields; after the catastrophic Piercing event, Te’Oga’s entire crust hummed with a new vibration, and when a massive global resonance was later triggered, it caused reality to oscillate violently (the Fathom Break). In essence, Soulpulse obeys physics-like laws of wave interference – constructive and destructive interference, propagation through mediums – giving it a rigorous logic even at its most fantastical. Masters of the art study pulse-field dynamics the way engineers study pressure systems, learning how energy distributes through materials and how far a change will ripple before dissipating.
Mechanics of Soulpulse: Attunement, Overtone, and Dissonance
Resonance Matching & Attunement: To produce a magical effect, a practitioner must attune to their target. This involves sensing or guessing the target’s natural frequency and gradually adjusting one’s Soulpulse output to match[11]. It is a subtle art akin to tuning a musical instrument or finding the right key in which to hum. In practice, the user focuses will, emotion, and often a precise gesture or tool, sending out a probing pulse. If the frequency aligns, resonance is achieved – metal strengthens or bends, wounds knit closed, toxins purge, flames spark, etc., depending on the intent and principle[8][6]. If the frequency is off by even a little, the user feels resistance – a dissonant feedback in their bones – warning them to adjust. Experienced Soulpulsers describe a tactile sensation when they're close to attunement: the world feels pliable, like a note on the verge of ringing true. By contrast, pushing ahead without attuning is like trying to force the wrong key into a lock: the magic “jams” and often backfires with pain or destructive consequences.
Attunement is easiest when one is patient and perceptive. “Don’t push. Invite. Glass will tell you when it’s ready,” as master glassmith Tiffani often instructs[12]. Her glass-working approach epitomizes attunement – gently heating and waiting for the material to respond – whereas a forge-trained smith might initially try to hammer change into the world. This difference played out when Tiffani taught Jhace: by measuring, listening, and guiding rather than brute-forcing, he found the broken glass and metal around him resonated and mended far better[13][14]. The lesson: Soulpulse isn’t raw force at all, but cooperative resonance[15]. Attunement can sometimes require multiple attempts or creative approaches – sensing temperature changes, audible hums, or emotional tone of a target – but once locked in, the effect feels almost effortless, as if the world itself completes the work.
Overtone Theory & Multi-Resonance: While most practitioners have one predominant resonance (their affinity principle), advanced Soulpulse use involves overtones – secondary frequencies that a user can layer atop their fundamental tone. In music, plucking a string produces not just one note but a series of harmonics; analogously, a skilled resonator might introduce a second principle as a harmonious overtone to their primary principle. This is exceedingly difficult and was long thought impossible beyond minor tricks. However, cases of dual-principle mastery proved overtones can be harnessed: Jhace himself instinctively used multiple resonance types in quick succession under battle duress[16], and Tiffani later deliberately combined Form + Wholeness resonance in a single act to perform an “impossible” healing[17][18]. They achieved a resonant chord, so to speak, balancing two frequencies in harmony. Overtone theory posits that all four principles are ultimately facets of one grand spectrum – meaning, in theory, a being could resonate with every principle at once if their soul could handle the complexity. This ultimate multi-resonance is called Confluence (all principles in simultaneous focus)[19]. It was only witnessed once – a desperate Jhace, in grief, unconsciously harmonized Form, Purity, Wholeness, and Entropy together, unleashing an unfathomably powerful omni-resonant pulse[20][21]. Overtone magic is powerful but perilous: the more principles intertwined, the more unstable the combined frequency. Even dual resonance puts extreme strain on body and mind (Tiffani’s vein-burn scar accelerated when she channeled two principles[22]). Only a unique soul or extraordinary circumstances can sustain a full Confluence without shattering.
Pulse-Field Feedback: Resonant energy tends to linger briefly as an echo in whatever medium was affected. After a Soulpulse action, the practitioner and environment carry residual vibrations – akin to a ringing that slowly fades. If one tries to use Soulpulse again immediately, these vein-echoes can interfere with the new attempt[23]. This phenomenon, known colloquially as echo stacking, can amplify errors: imagine trying to sing a new note while the old note’s echo still reverberates, causing discord. Practitioners must learn to either wait for the echo to dissipate or deliberately dampen it (through meditation or grounding techniques) before attempting another major pulse. Failure to do so often results in a jarring dissonance spike and severe vein-burn as the leftover vibrations clash with the new ones[24]. In group settings, pulse-field feedback is an even greater concern – multiple people working at near frequencies can accidentally create a resonant feedback loop. Teams of Continuity resonators (healers) learned this when too many tried to heal one patient simultaneously: their well-intentioned overlapping pulses caused a painful thrumming in the patient and themselves. Conversely, a team that staggers their efforts or harmonizes precisely can amplify effects safely (this disciplined coordination is what made grand construction projects possible in Prism – dozens of Form resonators all singing the same note, so to speak). Feedback loops are thus both a hazard and a tool – uncontrolled, they lead to Resonance Cascades and disasters; controlled, they lead to symphonies of power.
Dissonance and Failure Modes: When attunement fails, the results are immediate and often dramatic. Minor dissonance produces a harsh buzz of pain in the user’s veins and aborts the effect, often leaving a scorch mark on the user’s skin or the target object as a warning. Severe dissonance – actively clashing frequency output – causes immediate vein-burn and can even Vein-Snap the user’s internal channels[25]. A vein-snap is a metaphysical rupture analogous to a torn muscle: the practitioner might collapse, coughing blood or losing feeling in a limb as their soul-circuits temporarily shut down[25]. The environment doesn’t escape unscathed either; strong dissonance can shatter nearby glass, splinter wood, or buckle metal as the “wrong note” violently disagrees with reality[26][7]. One notable incident involved a young multi-resonant, Chloen, who attempted an advanced structural pulse she wasn’t attuned for – her arm and a nearby worker’s veins snapped from the backlash, and support beams around them fractured[27]. Such failures taught early practitioners hard limits.
Beyond immediate failures, there are cascading failures: if a resonator stubbornly pushes through dissonance, each subsequent attempt becomes more erratic as both user and target fall out of tune. In worst cases this leads to a Resonance Cascade (uncontrolled chain reaction) or even psychological break (extreme dissonance can flood the mind with static, inducing temporary madness or unconsciousness). Thus, a core law of Soulpulse emerged: the magic will “fight back” if forced. It is a dialogue, not a monologue. The more a user insists without listening, the more the resulting dissonance punishes them. This principle enforced humility and caution among those who might otherwise abuse such power.
The Four Divine Principles: Form, Purity, Wholeness, Entropy
In time, all Soulpulse abilities were understood to fall under one (or a combination) of Four Resonance Principles, which later gained near-mythic status as divine aspects. Each principle has distinct effects, costs, personality tendencies, and even drew its own following and cultural worship once their true power was revealed. Below is an in-depth look at each:
Form – The Principle of Structure and Order (Structural Resonance)
Essence & Effects: Form resonance embodies rigidity, structure, and ideal shape. Its frequency is described as high and crystalline, a sharp clarion ring that brings stillness and strength[28]. Form resonators can reinforce physical structures, impose geometric order on chaos, and “lock” objects or systems into their optimal configuration[28]. In practical use, this ranges from strengthening a collapsing building by infusing it with rigid energy, to straightening a bent metal beam, to creating barriers of force that hold fast. At its extremes, Form resonance can even crystallize fluids or mend shattered glass into seamless, symmetric patterns. The guiding intention is perfection – making things conform to an ideal blueprint.
Metaphysical Role: Form is often seen as the cosmic force of law and stability. It resists change and decay, seeking everlasting order. Its divine opposite is Entropy – whenever a Form user tries to preserve or create structure, entropy subtly works to unravel it over time. These two principles are in eternal tension, much like order vs chaos. Practically, a strong Form effect (say, magically reinforcing a fortress wall) will hold for long, but natural entropy will make it require periodic renewal, and a Dissolution adept might more easily undo another’s Form-work. Form is the skeleton of reality, giving shape to existence.
Costs & Limitations: The mantra of Form is “rigidity at a price.” Form practitioners gradually pay with their flexibility – both physical and mental. Prolonged use causes the user’s joints to stiffen and muscles to calcify[29]; many veteran Structuralists suffer from chronic pain or limited range of motion, as if their bodies are turning into the stone and metal they often reinforce. Symbolically, they risk becoming rigid in mind as well: an adherence to rules and perfectionism that can border on obsession. Early on, Corlexi (a gifted Form resonator) exemplified this cost – his fixation on geometric perfection and refusal to accept “good enough” were personality traits amplified by his resonance[30][31]. The physical toll was evident in practitioners who overused Form: calcified growths on bones, a literal ossification caused by channeling so much rigid energy. If pushed too far, Form users can experience Hollowing (detailed later) when their conviction in creating order collapses under impossible standards[32].
Personality & Traits: Those attuned to Form tend to be methodical, precise, and control-focused[33]. They often have engineering or architectural mindsets, seeing structures and systems in everything. Many were drawn from (or became) the Structuralist faction, known for bureaucracy and enforcing standards. Culturally, Structuralists (pejoratively called “The Rigid”) valued order above all – they instituted licensing for magic use to maintain control[34], and wore blue-silver insignia reflecting the crystalline blue-silver glow their Soulpulse emits in use[28]. The Form principle appeals to those who fear chaos; in the post-Piercing world of Te’Oga, many clung to Form as a way to rebuild and feel safe through rules and structure.
Worship & Mythos: After the Fathom Break, Form literally ascended in the figure of Xilcore, the God of Form (formerly Corlexi). In a blinding moment, Corlexi’s body restructured into a state of geometric perfection – he became a living avatar of law and structure[35]. Followers, including former Structuralists, proclaimed him the “God of Law”, seeing the hand of destiny in his transformation[36]. Entire swathes of survivors began worshiping Form in a religious sense – praying for stability and protection under Xilcore. The cultural image of Form thus shifted from a mere magical affinity to a divine principle of order: cities under Xilcore’s influence started to rebuild in grand symmetry, and draconian codes were enforced as though sins against structural perfection were sacrilege. The Personality of Form as a divine principle became dogmatic, unyielding, yet reassuring to those who craved certainty. Even before this apotheosis, temples and guild-halls had iconography of the “Great Builder” or “Architect” – concepts now understood to have been foreshadowing the coming of a Form deity. Yet even worshipers acknowledge the double-edged nature of this power: Form promises peace through order, but taken too far it can be tyrannical (crystal that traps life in static perfection). Culturally, Form’s rise caused friction with those who value freedom or change, setting the stage for ideological conflict with Entropy’s followers especially.
Purity – The Principle of Cleansing and Isolation (Purification Resonance)
Essence & Effects: Purity resonance revolves around separation, refinement, and absolution. It seeks to remove that which “does not belong” – whether physical impurities in materials, illness in a body, or even moral “corruption” in a system. Its frequency is often described as a clear, piercing tone with a singular focus, like a bell that cuts through noise. Purity resonators can cleanse water or food of toxins effortlessly, draw out poison or disease from a person, and purify metals or gems to an immaculate state. In combat or aggressive use, the same power becomes frightening: a Purity user can literally burn away whatever they deem impure. This might manifest as white-hot Soulpulse flames that incinerate impurities (for instance, burning out infection from flesh – or burning a living being whom the user sees as “impure”). One Purity adept, Mobel, in a duel pulled the impurities out of Jhace’s body – an agonizing technique that nearly tore him apart from within[37]. Purity’s positive side is holy and healing in appearance (removing only what shouldn’t be there), but in zealot hands it becomes a weapon of judgment, sparing nothing but an imagined perfect core.
Metaphysical Role: Purity serves as the cosmic filter. It is the force that divides light from darkness, the meaningful from the meaningless, striving for an unattainable absolute perfection. Its opposite principle is Wholeness (Continuity). Where Wholeness seeks to join and heal regardless of imperfections, Purity insists that only by excising the flawed can true integrity be achieved. These philosophies are fundamentally at odds: one inclusive, one exclusive. On a cosmic scale, Purity can be thought of as the principle of singularity – narrowing the world down to a single truth or essence by eliminating all else. This makes it a dangerously absolute power, one that doesn’t lend itself to balance. Unsurprisingly, it was the least understood (and most feared) of the four principles until late in the Chronicles; it hid in the shadows, quietly intensifying in isolated pockets (like remote temples) until it exploded onto the world stage.
Costs & Limitations: The pursuit of purity is inherently a path of sacrifice and self-harm. Those who channel Purity frequently experience the need to sacrifice parts of themselves – metaphorically and literally. Physically, Purity resonance tends to manifest as searing heat or caustic energy through the user’s veins. Practitioners often exhibit inflammation, cracked skin, or painful swelling in the parts of their body they use most[38][39]. (Mobel, the archetypal Purity user, had swollen, aching joints and irritated skin from incessant ritual cleaning and channeling of purity energy[38][39].) It is as if the resonance “burns away” impurities within the user as well – including beneficial elements – leaving them physically brittle over time. On a psychological level, the cost is isolation. The more one devotes to Purity, the more one tends to grow severe, uncompromising, and isolated from others. Relationships may fall away as the user’s worldview turns absolutist. Purity users often develop an all-or-nothing mentality that brooks no empathy for mistakes (in themselves or others), which can lead to loneliness and fanaticism. There is also a spiritual warning: some say that absolute purity is akin to emptiness. Push Purity to its limit and you risk erasing so much “impurity” that nothing remains, including your own humanity. Indeed, when Mobel’s powers reached their apex during the Fathom Break, his body combusted in a violent, self-immolating transformation – he became a being of pure, cleaving fire but lost even his name, turning into the fearsome entity “Blemo”[40]. That is Purity’s final cost: to purge everything, even oneself.
Personality & Traits: Purity-aligned individuals tend to be zealous, idealistic, and inflexible. In gentle form, this can mean a devout person with high standards and personal discipline (e.g. a healer who fastidiously sterilizes tools and rituals). In extreme form, it produces fanatics who see the world in black and white. Mobel started as a temple keeper obsessed with cleanliness rituals – a quiet man of faith whose obsession grew in the post-Piercing chaos: if the world was broken and “contaminated” by lattice dust, he felt only absolute purification rituals could restore meaning[30][31]. This anxious fixation is common in Purity practitioners; they often develop OCD-like behaviors, fixating on minute imperfections. They are typically not easygoing people – expect stubbornness, a tendency to judge others harshly, and a kind of righteous impatience. Culturally, no large “Purity faction” arose at first (unlike Form, Wholeness, Entropy which had Structuralists, Continuists, Releasers). Instead, Purity simmered in certain religious sects and among individuals like Mobel. It wasn’t until later that these people coalesced, and when they did, it was as a radical movement rather than an organized guild. People fearful of moral decay or magical pollution found themselves drawn to Purity’s promise of cleansing fire. There is also a personal cost in personality: many Purity users become increasingly ascetic. They give up pleasures (viewed as indulgences that “pollute” the soul), often leading spartan, joyless lives in pursuit of an ever-receding ideal.
Worship & Mythos: The Fathom Break elevated Purity to outright godhood in the form of Blemo, the Purity Incarnate (formerly Mobel). Blemo emerged from a literal baptism by fire – a figure of living flame and judgment, separating “pure from impure” with a mere glance[41]. In the aftermath, radical devotees rallied to Blemo[41]. They saw the apocalyptic destruction that occurred (much of it caused by Purity’s unchecked power) not as tragedy but as a necessary purging of a corrupt world. Thus, Purity gained a cult of worship that espouses extreme doctrine: only those deemed pure (by their new god’s standards) deserve to inherit the new world. Culturally, this has translated into frightening practices – “Scourgers” traveling to burn out pockets of perceived corruption, communities undergoing forced purification rites. Even before Blemo’s rise, the idea of purity had religious connotations (sin and absolution). Now, with a tangible god, Purity theology exploded into something resembling theocracies in areas under Blemo’s influence. The personality of Purity as a deity is uncompromising and wrathful; Blemo is worshiped with both awe and fear as a god who grants salvation through destruction. Some cultures refer to Purity’s divine aspect as “The Cleansing Flame” or “The All-White Light” – interestingly, a light that tolerates no colors (no diversity). In mythic terms, Purity is the promise of paradise if one can eliminate every impurity – a promise that has led many down a fanatical path. Its interplay with Wholeness’s merciful, inclusive goddess (Leesa) forms a dramatic religious dichotomy post-Fathom: compassion vs. judgement.
Wholeness – The Principle of Continuity and Connection (Continuity Resonance)
Essence & Effects: Wholeness (often called Continuity by practitioners) is the resonance of connection, healing, and unity. Its signature is a warm, mid-range frequency that feels like a gentle hum or heartbeat in the air[42]. Wholeness resonators excel at mending and linking: they can heal wounds by knitting tissues together, repair shattered objects by re-establishing their continuity, and even bridge disparate elements (for instance, binding a metal joint to a glass pane seamlessly). The effect is to make something whole again, whether literally (healing a broken bone, closing a rift in a wall) or metaphorically (soothing emotional discord, strengthening community bonds through empathic resonance). Continuity magic often manifests as a copper-gold glow enveloping the target[42] – a visual sign of life and warmth returning. A classic example is Jhace’s first uncontrolled Soulpulse: desperate to save his friend, he unconsciously resonated with her body and the metal trapping her, causing both the metal’s cracks and her head wound to knit closed simultaneously[8][43]. Wholeness can also extend to maintaining energy flow (practitioners used it to stabilize Te’Oga’s failing heat-grid by closing gaps and smoothing the flow of heat currents). Uniquely, Wholeness resonance can create empathic links – a healer might take on a bit of a patient’s pain to relieve them, or link two people’s energies so they bolster each other. In summary, Wholeness is about integration**: making the many function as one.
Metaphysical Role: Wholeness/Continuity stands as the force of unity in the cosmos. It is opposed to Purity’s divisive ethos. Whereas Purity splits and isolates, Wholeness joins and includes. Its divine opposite is Purity, making these two principles a moral dichotomy: compassion vs. zealotry, acceptance vs. exclusion. Wholeness seeks to preserve the web of life; it treats the world’s brokenness by weaving threads back together. It’s also inherently about continuum – seeing past, present, future as a connected flow, and individuals as parts of a greater whole. This principle underpinned the philosophy of the Continuists (hence the name): the idea that knowledge and power should flow freely among people, and that cooperation is strength[44][45]. On a grand scale, one might say Wholeness is what keeps reality “sticking together” – the glue of existence, ensuring that when things fall apart, they can find their way back. It opposes not only Purity but also counters the fragmenting effect of unchecked entropy (though Wholeness ultimately accepts entropy as part of the life-cycle, focusing on meaningful connections until the end).
Costs & Limitations: Wholeness users pay a cost of self-blurring and emotional burden. Because their magic works by connecting themselves to the target (even if metaphorically), they often feel what the target feels. To heal, a Continuity resonator must open themselves up, creating an empathic bridge. This can lead to Identity Bleed – the user’s sense of self can become diffuse, especially after many healings or connections[46]. They might pick up fragments of others’ emotions or memories, or simply lose track of where their needs end and others’ begin[46]. Many Continuity practitioners report that after intense sessions, they have trouble remembering their own desires, feeling instead the echo of those they helped. This is closely linked to what’s known as Sympathetic Overload, a dangerous state where a healer is too attuned to a patient and cannot disengage – essentially being trapped in resonance with the other’s pain[47]. In those cases, the healer might literally experience the injury or trauma of the patient as if it were their own, and require another to break the link[47]. Physically, Wholeness use still causes vein-burn if done improperly, but its unique strain is fatigue. Knitting things together takes energy; Wholeness practitioners often feel drained to the point of exhaustion after heavy use, as if they poured a part of their life force into sustaining someone else. There is also the long-term cost of personal boundaries eroding: Tiffani, who was a gifted Continuity (Wholeness) resonator as well as a Structural resonator, had to teach herself restraint – by N03 she used Soulpulse sparingly because each use exacerbated her chronic pain and hand tremors[48] (partly due to structural cost, partly due to Wholeness overuse causing her to literally feel everyone’s hurt around her, a psychological toll). Thus, Wholeness demands balance: healers must remember to heal themselves and maintain identity, or they “bleed out” emotionally.
Personality & Traits: Those aligned with Wholeness tend to be empathetic, compassionate, and collaborative[42]. They often instinctively seek to help and bring people together. Many were natural medics, caregivers, or community organizers even before discovering their magic. In conflict, they prefer reconciliation to victory. This personality made Wholeness the heart of the largest early faction, the Continuists (“Bleeders”)[44]. Continuists championed open access to knowledge and healing for all, shunning the notion of restricting Soulpulse by licenses or hierarchy[44][45]. They earned the nickname “Bleeders” both because their healing often involved taking on others’ suffering (bleeding themselves) and as a play on their tendency to let resources and help flow freely (bleeding out aid without reservation). What some saw as self-sacrificing virtue, critics saw as lack of boundaries or “bleeding heart” naiveté. Continuity resonators also exhibit a strong sense of community identity – they often find strength in numbers and support networks. A downside in personality can be indecisiveness or enabling behavior: wanting to save everyone, they sometimes struggle to make hard choices (for example, a Wholeness user might exhaust themselves trying to save multiple wounded instead of prioritizing, potentially saving none). Still, their presence is literally life-saving. It was noted that in any large settlement, the Continuity-affined naturally gravitated to roles like nurses, mediators, or teachers, knitting society together post-catastrophe.
Worship & Mythos: The apotheosis of Wholeness came in the form of Leesa, Goddess of Wholeness (born from Salee). During the Confluence/Fathom event, Salee, a healer, absorbed a massive wave of others’ pain and in doing so transcended – she became a living avatar of mercy, instantly healing dozens around her[49][50]. Revered as a Goddess of Compassion, Leesa’s emergence turned the Continuist ethic into a literal religion. Worshipers of Leesa see her as the embodiment of the Motherly Principle: all are connected in her embrace. Temples to Leesa emphasize communal care, and her followers (sometimes called Healers or Mercykin) travel to war-torn or plague-ridden areas to perform miraculous healings in her name. Under Leesa’s influence, the ideology of Wholeness sharpened: mercy is paramount, even to one’s own detriment. Ethically, this has raised dilemmas – some Leesa devotees take a vow to take on the suffering of others, which can become problematic if done recklessly. Theologically, Wholeness is seen as the divine light of unity, the promise that “all broken things shall be made whole.” It is a comforting doctrine in a shattered world. However, even among her faithful, there is a cautionary tale: Leesa’s own transformation required enormous sacrifice (she literally had to embrace the suffering of countless dying to ascend). Thus, priests of Wholeness teach balance and consent – one should not force healing where it’s refused, and one must not martyr oneself to the point of “hollowing out,” as even compassion has limits. In contrast to Blemo’s harsh puritanism, Leesa’s creed is one of unconditional love – making their factions natural enemies in the post-Fathom era.
Entropy – The Principle of Dissolution and Endings (Dissolution Resonance)
Essence & Effects: Entropy (often termed Dissolution resonance) governs decay, release, and the gentle ushering of endings. Its frequency is low, soft, and fading, often likened to a deep sigh or the final note of a song trailing off[51]. Entropy resonators can accelerate decay in materials (rust iron to brittle flakes in seconds, cause plants to wither or fruit to rot at a touch), dissolve bonds (undo mortar between bricks, weaken barriers), and ease transitions (most notably, easing the dying in their final moments or calming severe pain by encouraging the body to let go). Unlike Purity’s destructive flame, Entropy’s touch is quiet and often invisible – things simply fall apart, usually peacefully. In a controlled context, Dissolution can be incredibly useful: disposing of waste safely, composting dead matter into fertile soil rapidly, or dismantling damaged structures without explosives. On a battlefield or conflict scenario, Entropy magic might manifest as ghostly gray energy that causes enemy weapons to corrode and crumble mid-swing, or induces exhaustion and surrender in foes by making them acutely feel the weight of all things ending. It’s notably effective at dispelling other magical constructs – an entropy pulse can unravel a Form resonance structure or nullify ongoing spells by encouraging them to conclude. A hallmark story of Entropy resonance is of Eries, a novitiate fascinated with death: she possessed the calm ability to crystallize and shatter flora around her in moments of stress, essentially speeding their life cycle to a beautiful end[52][53]. Her perspective – “what was solid becomes soft, what resisted yields” – perfectly encapsulates Entropy’s ethos[54][55].
Metaphysical Role: Entropy is the end of the cycle, the force that ensures nothing is permanent so that new beginnings can occur. It is not malicious destruction but completion. Its divine opposite is Form – order and permanence vs. impermanence and release. When Form builds a towering edifice, Entropy is the patience that eventually wears it down. Importantly, Entropy in this magical context carries a nuance of acceptance. It aligns with philosophies that embrace death as natural and see decay as necessary for renewal (the fallen leaves nourishing new growth). Among the four principles, Entropy is the one most closely tied to time and the natural lifecycle. Practitioners often speak of “the Fading” – the moment of ending – as something sacred. In Te’Oga’s cultural landscape, this principle was openly revered by the Releaser faction (the “Enders”) even before any godhood manifested[56]. Releasers believed in making endings gentle and purposeful, whether that meant euthanizing someone beyond saving or letting a crumbling structure collapse in a controlled way rather than forcing it to stand. Entropy ensures that struggle ceases and peace follows, as one sacred text described[54][57].
Costs & Limitations: For those who channel Entropy, the primary cost is vitality and motivation. They give a bit of their own life energy to fuel the hastening of decay (or they align with the ambient decay energy, which is a cold, draining force). After significant use, Dissolution resonators report feeling profound fatigue, melancholy, and a sense of emptiness[51]. It’s as if in ending other things, they themselves inch closer to an ending. Many Entropy practitioners struggle with depression or apathy: connecting deeply with the principle of “everything ends” can sap one’s drive to begin or sustain anything. Physical signs of overuse include premature aging (some heavy users found streaks of gray hair or persistent weariness in youth) and a certain chill in the limbs – their circulatory system metaphorically slows. They can also experience moments of dissociation, a symptom of their identity loosening much like Wholeness users, but for a different reason: rather than blending with others, they detach from everything. In extreme cases, an Entropy user might become frighteningly emotionless or passive, having accepted fate to a harmful degree. Another limitation is that Entropy cannot be selective once set in motion. If not carefully directed, a dissolution effect might spread beyond its intended target (rot doesn’t stop easily). Thus, finesse is needed to avoid collateral decay. For example, dissolving the bonds of one stone in a wall, if done sloppily, could propagate weakness to adjacent stones – a skilled Dissolution resonator learns to “pluck just the one thread” rather than unravel the whole tapestry at once. Overconfidence or carelessness can result in over-dissolution – a scenario where more ends than the user intended, which can be disastrous if, say, you only meant to wither enemy crops but end up blighting your own fields as well. Therefore, many Entropy practitioners adopt a careful, measured approach by necessity (which suits their temperament).
Personality & Traits: Those attuned to Entropy tend to be calm, accepting, and often introspective[57][58]. They are the types who are comfortable with solitude and have made peace with loss. In the immediate aftermath of the Piercing, many who resonated with Entropy became hospice workers, undertakers, or counselors for the grieving – roles that fit their natural inclination to provide comfort at the end. They are sometimes seen as morbid or overly pessimistic by others, but in truth many Dissolution resonators are gentle souls who simply view death and decay as truths rather than tragedies. The Releasers (Enders) faction embodied this, operating in burial grounds and quarantine zones, wearing ash-gray veils and performing quiet rites[56]. Their motto could be “All things, in time.” Personality-wise, they may come off as detached or fatalistic (“what will be, will be”). However, their detachment gives them grace under pressure – while others panic, an Entropy adept remains composed, doing what must be done even if it means triaging or letting go of something precious. They also often have a wry sense of humor about life’s transience. One notable trait is empathy through witnessing (as opposed to Wholeness’s empathy through sharing) – they won’t absorb your pain, but they will sit with you through it unflinchingly. Some can be overly passive, failing to act until it’s too late, because they assume the natural course should not be altered. This was a criticism leveled at figures like Venn, a Dissolution master who led the Releasers: he believed in minimal intervention, which was merciful in some cases but perceived as cold neglect in others.
Worship & Mythos: In the wake of Fathom Break, Entropy’s pure incarnation appeared as Seeri (once Eries). Seeri became a kind of goddess of peaceful endings and enlightenment[52][59]. Her transformation was marked not by fire or explosion, but by a serene dissolution: nearby flora crystallized and shattered beautifully as she herself transcended, leaving her with an aura of calm finality[52][59]. Wanderers and common folk who saw this proclaimed her enlightenment, akin to a Buddha of entropy[60]. Seeri’s worshipers are often philosophers, nomads, or those traumatized by the endless struggles – they seek solace in Seeri’s message that ending is not to be feared. As a deity, Seeri doesn’t command large militant orders but rather a diffuse following of philosophers and sages. It’s noted that about a year after the Break, a faction of “Philosophers” had emerged, likely those who follow Entropy’s contemplative approach[61]. They preach that the Era of Gods is a natural evolution and that clinging to the old world only brings suffering. Their ethics emphasize mercy-killing to end suffering and the dissolution of corrupt institutions to allow rebirth. In art, Seeri is depicted as a figure of glass and petals drifting away, embodying beauty in transience. Her rise turned many Releasers’ practices into religious sacraments: funerals became holy send-offs with resonance rituals guiding souls to rest, and even daily chores like composting got spiritual significance. The mythology around Entropy thus reinforces the idea that in every end, there is peace. Still, Seeri’s followers can be radical in their own quiet way: a subset called “The Yielded” believe in hastening the end of the age of human toil entirely, essentially welcoming apocalypse as the ultimate act of mercy and renewal. This demonstrates that even a principle about acceptance has its dogma when deified.
Soulpulse Progression Across the Five Phases (N01–N05)
Over the course of the five novellas of The Confluence Chronicles, the understanding and application of Soulpulse magic evolved dramatically. Each narrative phase – Ember, Shaping, Alloy, Prism, Confluence/Fathom – corresponds to a stage in the magic system’s development, from rudimentary spark to world-altering crescendo. Below is a breakdown of how Soulpulse progresses through these phases:
Ember Phase – Awakening the Spark (Novella 1, “Ember”)
The Ember Phase represents the ignition of Soulpulse in the world. In the immediate aftermath of the Piercing (a cataclysmic event where a massive projectile pierced Te’Oga, wreaking havoc[4][1]), magic first flared in desperate responses to disaster. People didn’t yet know what Soulpulse was – it was a mysterious power awakened by crisis, an ember of hope in the ruins. Key developments and characteristics of this phase:
*         
First         Sparks of Magic: Soulpulse usage was inadvertent and         instinctual. The classic example is Jhace in the ruins of a         collapsed district: with no training, he somehow caused debris to         shift and a grievous wound to heal when trying to save his         sister-figure Chloen[8][43].         He had no name for what he did, only the result – a life saved and         his own arms scorched by unseen energy. Similarly, others across         Te’Oga experienced small miracles or weird occurrences as they         struggled to survive (a child’s cry causing shattered glass to         reassemble around them, a panicked smith accidentally fusing a         broken pipe shut by yelling at it, etc.). These events were isolated         embers in the dark, hinting at a new force.
*         
Catastrophe         and Necessity: The Piercing left the world literally tilted (the         planet’s axis realigned) and infrastructure in ruins[62][1].         Out of necessity, survivors began cooperating across old guild         lines. Former rival crafters – the forge-smiths and glass-smiths –         had to combine their knowledge to stabilize buildings and the vital         heat-grid that kept cities warm[63][64].         In this pressure cooker of necessity, Soulpulse was frequently         triggered by strong emotions: fear, love, determination. It was         unreliable – a phenomenon that “just happened” when         people reached emotional peaks – but those early successes (and         failures) planted the seed that something beyond tools was at         work.
*         
The         Piercing’s Magical Aftermath: The environment itself was         altered. Most notably, the Piercing created Lattice Dust, a         fine glittering dust that fell like ash everywhere and coated         everything with a faint hum[65].         This dust, a byproduct of whatever energy was unleashed, became a         permanent feature and early on was just a nuisance and health hazard         (it irritated lungs and corroded metals)[66].         But crucially, its presence hinted that the world had been         “suffused” with a new resonance – the dust literally hummed         with faint magical vibration[65].         In Ember phase, people didn’t know what to do about it, but some         observant characters (like Tiffani) noted that the dust tended to         gather or respond when Soulpulse was used, almost like iron filings         around a magnet. Thus, the dust served as a visible marker of the         invisible: magic was now in the very air and ash.
*         
Learning         Through Crisis: The Ember phase was characterized by trial by         fire. There were many mishaps: a person might desperately try to         replicate a Soulpulse feat and end up with severe vein-burn or         collapsing from a vein-snap, not understanding the limitations. Each         time, though, small lessons were learned. For instance, after         Jhace’s arms were vein-burned, Tiffani observed the glowing         pattern in his veins and realized this energy traveled through         specific channels – she later cautioned him to “manage that         cost”[67][68],         one of the first acknowledgments that using this power has lasting         consequences. In another instance, a group of survivors attempted a         communal effort to lift rubble by all pushing with their will –         the resulting dissonance knocked everyone flat and caused a minor         quake. From failure, they learned that too many at once without         coordination made things worse. Essentially, Ember was chaotic;         knowledge was sparse and empirical. Yet by the end of Novella 1, the         protagonists had a glimmer of understanding: they knew Soulpulse was         real, repeatable (if still mysterious), and that cooperation and         careful technique seemed key to wielding it safely. The novella ends         on a hopeful note: a partially stabilized heat-grid hums with         a new kind of energy and the survivors share a sense that they have         discovered the “spark that will hold their world together”[69].         The metaphor of an ember is apt – small and fragile, but with         potential to grow into something powerful if properly stoked.
Shaping Phase – First Understanding and Systematization (Novella 2, “Shaping”)
In the Shaping Phase, the characters move from mere survival to curiosity and experimentation, attempting to shape a coherent system out of the chaos. This is when Soulpulse began to be studied, named, and taught (albeit informally). Key features of this phase:
   *         
Discovery         of Resonance Theory: The breakthrough comes when Tiffani and         other thinkers conduct deliberate experiments on Soulpulse         phenomena. They identify that it’s all about vibration and         frequency matching, essentially formulating the core principle:         Soulpulse is sympathetic resonance magic, not brute force[15].         They observe that success comes when the user seems “in tune”         with the material (e.g., humming at a certain pitch while working         made things easier) and failure comes with discord. This is         articulated clearly for the first time: “You can’t force         something to change; you have to resonate with it until it wants to         change.”[15]         This understanding marks the true birth of Soulpulse as a knowable         system. Terminology emerges: they speak of “finding the right         frequency” of a task, of achieving “resonance”         versus creating “dissonance”, and of “attunement”         as the process to get there[70][7].         Essentially, the Shaping phase is about learning the rules.
   *         
Lexicon         Expansion: A whole new vocabulary is coined as         trial-and-error results are discussed among practitioners[71][7].         Some key terms defined during this phase:
   *         
Frequency/Resonance: The unique         vibration of person or object[72].
   *         
Harmonic: When two people’s pulses         align naturally, allowing synergistic teamwork[9]         (rare, but now understood as something to strive for in paired         efforts).
   *         
Dissonance: The identified word for         the painful clash that had hurt so many; now people knew to avoid         “causing dissonance” by mismatched attempts[7].
   *         
Attuning: The method of gradually         adjusting one’s output to sync with the target[11].
   *         
Vein-burn: They name the internal         injuries, realizing it’s a direct consequence of dissonance (like         friction burn in the magical veins)[43][6].
   *         
Vein-Echo:         Discovered when practitioners noted a “ringing” in their senses         after using Soulpulse; they learned not to spam their power because         the echo needed to fade[23].         Each term gave practitioners power over the phenomenon through         understanding. By naming it, they could teach it and avoid pitfalls         more systematically.
   *         
Catastrophic         Failures and Lessons: The Shaping phase still saw plenty of         accidents – in fact, the drive to experiment meant new         types of failures occurred. Some notable ones:
   *         
Vein-Snap incidents became         well-documented; people learned how far they could push their         internal channels. If someone collapsed coughing blood, it was         recognized as vein-snap and not a mysterious illness, prompting         protocols like enforced rest for those individuals[25].
   *         
Resonance Cascade became a feared term         after an incident where an out-of-tune pulse triggered a chain         reaction that brought down an entire half-repaired building[10].         This taught them that large-scale Soulpulse work had to be planned         with failsafes (e.g. smaller contained pulses rather than one         massive blast, or using damping materials around).
   *         
Sympathetic         Overload was first observed directly during this phase: a healer         attuning to a grievously injured patient started screaming in agony         as if the injuries were hers[47].         Only when another practitioner jarred her with a forceful shove         (breaking her concentration) did she snap out. This led to the         practice of partner oversight – whenever someone attempted         deep healing, a second person would monitor and be ready to break         the connection if needed[47].         These failures were shared in emerging scholarly notes (the closest         thing to academia at that time, mostly letters between guild members         and open discussions in relief camps).
   *         
Factions         Forming – Affinity Realization: As more people experimented,         it became clear that individuals had affinities for certain         kinds of effects[73][28].         This was the era when, thanks to Tiffani’s “resonance mapping         method”, people lined up to test which frequency felt most natural         to them[74][75].         The discovery: roughly three major types (plus hints of a fourth)         emerged:
   *         
Structural Resonators (Form-aligned) –         those whose energy ran high and sharp, excellent at reinforcing and         structuring[28].
   *         
Continuity Resonators (Wholeness-aligned) –         those with warm, midrange energy ideal for mending and         connecting[42].
   *         
Dissolution Resonators (Entropy-aligned) –         those with low, soft energy attuned to decay and gentle endings[51].
   *         
Purity         – at this stage, Purity was not officially recognized as a         separate affinity by the general populace; however, there were “odd         ones” who didn’t cleanly fit the three and exhibited signs of         something else (e.g. an unusually intense, narrow resonance that         didn’t mend or simply decay, but burned selectively). Only         later would they realize these were Purity attuned individuals.         During Shaping, such people might have been lumped in with         Structuralists or seen as aberrant. Mobel’s early increasingly         strict purification rituals (from N01’s interlude through N02)         were a case in point: he had a resonance that aggravated his body         (swollen joints) and seemed to do nothing except cause pain         unless channeled into cleansing acts[38][31].         Those like him were outliers who didn’t yet form a public group.         As people identified their affinities, the old guild system         (forge vs. glass) indeed fractured entirely[76][73].         New alliances formed around these resonance types, because a         structural resonator smith might find more common ground with a         structural resonator architect than with a non-resonant smith. By         the end of Shaping phase, the seeds of the later factions         (Structuralists, Continuists, Releasers) were firmly planted, even         if formal faction names were only just emerging[77][78].
   *         
Cultural         Shifts: With knowledge spreading, Soulpulse began to be seen not         as miraculous anomaly but as a craft in its own right.         Populace attitudes shifted from fear to a mix of awe and normalizing         curiosity. There were public demonstrations – Tiffani’s         organized testing events attracted hundreds[74][79].         For many common folk, witnessing Soulpulse use went from “terrifying         display” to “useful service” during this phase. Also, the         economics started shifting: those with useful resonance skills         became in high demand for reconstruction work. The Shaping phase         ends with a sense of structured learning – a small academy         of thought forming even if not literally in a school. By now the         world has the basic grammar of the magic, setting the stage for more         advanced uses and, unfortunately, conflicts over how it should be         used.
Alloy Phase – Conflict, Fusion, and Limits Tested (Novella 3, “Alloy”)
The Alloy Phase is where multiple elements – knowledge, factions, personal ideologies – fuse and clash. Just as an alloy is a mixture of metals forged in fire, this stage sees the forging of alliances and the eruption of conflicts that test the limits of the magic system and its users. Key aspects include:
      *         
Factional Solidification and Clash:         What was seeded in Shaping blooms (or festers) in Alloy. The three         main affinity-based factions fully form:
      *         
Structuralists (Form-aligned) entrench         their power, advocating strict regulation of Soulpulse use “for         the greater good of order.” They begin enforcing Resonance         Licensing in their territories[34]         – anyone practicing magic must be certified, echoing their ethos         of control and fear of chaos. They see Soulpulse as something that         must be governed like any dangerous resource.
      *         
Continuists (Wholeness-aligned)         coalesce into a loose network championing open sharing and mutual         aid, resisting any regulation[45].         They are disorganized by nature (preferring consensus over         hierarchy) but very numerous, acting as healers and community         supporters wherever they go.
      *         
Releasers (Entropy-aligned) remain         smaller and more philosophically detached, but by now recognized as         vital – they handle burials, disease containment, and mercy         killings when needed, all with solemn respect[56].         They often stay neutral or mediate between the other two, though         their fatalism sometimes puts them at odds with both.
      *         
Purity-aligned individuals still don’t         have a named faction, but their presence is felt in rising extremist         rhetoric especially within certain Structuralist offshoots or         religious circles. Some Structuralists who were particularly zealous         about “cleaning up” misuse or “removing” unlicensed mages         might actually be Purity-inclined without knowing it. They would         later break off, but in Alloy they mostly operate as hardliners         within other groups.
These factions begin territorial disputes[80]. For example, Structuralist enforcers (often referred to by others as “bluecoats” or derisively as “Locksteppers”) might arrest a Continuist healer for unauthorized practice, leading to skirmishes. A Continuist safehouse offering free magical mending might be attacked by extremists who blame uncontrolled magic for accidents. Novella 3’s events show a tragic escalation: a secret cross-faction meeting aimed at peace (organized by an idealistic multi-resonant youth, Chloen) ends in a massacre by Structuralist extremists, fearing that uncontrolled collaboration would threaten their order[81][82]. Chloen’s death in that massacre is an emotional turning point – it brutally demonstrates how far apart the factions have drifted and that neutrality is becoming impossible[83][84]. In Alloy phase, conflict pushes Soulpulse usage to new contexts: espionage (sensing spies via pulse-sense), sabotage (Structuralists use Form resonance to covertly weaken structures in Continuist zones and frame them as accidents[85]), and open street battles where magic is weaponized in improvised ways.
         *         
Personal         Fusion of Techniques: On the more positive side, “Alloy”         also symbolizes integration of methods. Characters like Jhace         and Tiffani truly combine their forge and glass guild teachings into         a unified approach to Soulpulse. By now, Jhace has learned         patience and precision, and Tiffani has learned to trust intuition         at times – together they develop dual-craft techniques that         revolutionize repair work[86][14].         They effectively create an alloy of methodologies, showing         others that synergy yields better results than rivalry. This         influences many on the ground: e.g., Kylar, a smith who was         initially a stubborn Structuralist, witnesses the success of         combined techniques and “stops competing, starts         collaborating”, joining their efforts[87][88].         This shows that even amid factional conflict, at the individual         level there is hope for fusion and understanding – a recurring         theme.
         *         
Pushing the         Limits of Capacity: Alloy phase brings the first instances of         people deliberately trying to exceed known limits – often         with dire consequences – thus revealing where the hard boundaries         lie.
         *         
Multi-resonance attempts: We see or         hear of more individuals who, like Jhace, might have the potential         for more than one resonance. Chloen, who was multi-resonant,         tragically dies early, but her existence proves it’s possible to         have breadth. Tiffani, by the end of this phase, hints at her own         hidden dual affinity (though she doesn’t yet openly reveal it).         The idea of combining principles is no longer unthinkable; some         scholars begin theorizing about harmonics, though it’s more an         academic question at this stage.
         *         
Overuse and Hollowing: With conflicts         raging, some practitioners start overusing their powers         severely. We hear of frontline healers who attend to wounded for         days without rest, Structuralist taskmasters forcing teams to lift         entire buildings in one go – and then the fallout. Hollowing         cases appear: the term coined for those who have essentially “burned         out” their Soulpulse completely[89].         They end up in a catatonic state, veins inert, eyes vacant,         resonance dead inside them – a fate worse than normal exhaustion         because it’s permanent[89].         Alloy phase provides the first confirmed hollows. It’s a grim         warning that there are no infinite batteries; one’s conviction and         spirit can be shattered by overextension. Notably, Jhace         himself becomes so fearful of the sympathetic overload incident and         of causing harm that in N03 (Alloy) he uses Soulpulse very         sparingly[90][91],         indicating a growing awareness of personal limit.
         *         
Emotional         Toll and Ethics: The heavy events of Alloy push characters into         questioning the ethics of Soulpulse use. For instance, after         Chloen’s death, Tiffani and Jhace both conclude that standing         aside (neutral) is no longer viable – not using their gifts         can enable tragedy[92][81].         This is a maturation in understanding: the magic system isn’t just         a neutral tool; how it’s used or not used has moral weight. They         realize Soulpulse has socio-political consequences and thus users         must take responsibility for those. This introspection sets the         stage for more structured principles or “laws” of responsible         use later.
         *         
Technology         and Soulpulse Fusion: By the end of Alloy, we see the beginnings         of Soul-tech integration. For example, some engineers among         the Structuralists devise resonance-based alarm systems (crystal         sensors that ring when unauthorized pulses occur). The idea of a         device that could suppress or detect Soulpulse is floated         (foreshadowing the suppression tech in the next phase). Meanwhile,         Continuists experiment with healing gadgets, like lattice-dust         salves that vibrate to promote healing when activated by a user’s         pulse. These are prototypes, but they mark the start of a         forge-punk/glass-punk spin on the magic: physical devices augmenting         or channeling resonance.
The Alloy phase thus is one of tension and combination – the world is figuratively alloying disparate elements (for good and ill). It ends on a somber note with guilds collapsed into warring factions and the main characters steeling themselves to intervene more directly in these conflicts, acknowledging that the system they helped shape is being used to both heal and harm. It’s the calm before an even bigger storm, as all sides prepare for the trials of the next stage.
Prism Phase – Refinement, Extremes, and Breaking Points (Novella 4, “Prism”)
The Prism Phase, named for the idea of a prism splitting light into distinct colors, is characterized by specialization, clarity, and also fragmentation. Here the four principles and their practitioners reach new heights and extremes, as if the earlier “alloy” has now been split into its pure components under pressure. Major elements of this stage:
            *         
Peak         Specialization & The Visionary Project: In this phase, each         faction doubles down on its ideals, yielding remarkable advancements         and dire consequences. The Structuralists under Master Corlexi         (dubbed “The Visionary”) embark on an ambitious project in the         city of Prism: constructing a massive geometric glass tower         meant to be a testament to Form resonance – perfect angles,         flawless structure, built by hundreds of resonators working in         unison[93][94].         This is Form taken to an extreme ideal. The project pushes         Structural resonators beyond safe limits in pursuit of perfection.         It ends in catastrophe: two top apprentices Hollow mid-ritual,         unable to sustain the intense constant resonance, and the partially         raised tower collapses spectacularly[94][95].         Corlexi himself begins to Hollow as well – essentially a breakdown         of the most gifted Form user under the weight of his own impossible         goal[95].         The Visionary’s Grand Project serves as a caution: it shows         that even with all their knowledge, the practitioners are not         immune to hubris. It also illustrates the concept of         god-compulsion emerging – Corlexi was driven by an almost         superhuman obsession as if the principle of Form itself was         overtaking his human limits[96].
            *         
Emergence         of Dual-Principle Masters: Prism phase is when the secret about         dual resonance finally comes to light. Tiffani, who had been         trained by an unknown mentor pre-Piercing, reveals in a critical         moment that she can deliberately wield two principles at once         (Form and Wholeness)[97][98].         She does this to save Jhace from near death by healing him with         Wholeness while structurally reinforcing his failing body with         Form[99][17].         This revelation astonishes those around her – until then, Jhace’s         occasional multi-principle flairs were chalked up to unique         instinct, and formal doctrine held that one person could not channel         two resonances simultaneously. Tiffani’s act proves multi-affinity         can be a trained skill, not just a fluke[100].         It hints at deeper knowledge (her mysterious mentor clearly knew         more about Soulpulse than most). This development is pivotal because         it cracks open the door for broader thinking: if two principles are         possible in one person, what about three or all four? It sets the         stage for the concept of Confluence. Culturally, Tiffani’s         dual mastery remains rare – by the end of Prism phase, she’s         perhaps the only one openly doing it – but it plants seeds of both         hope (maybe unified use can solve problems) and fear (mixing powers         could be dangerously uncharted, akin to playing god).
            *         
Worsening         Hollowing & Conviction Crisis: With multiple incidents of         overextension (the Visionary’s collapse, war skirmishes, etc.),         Hollowing becomes a recognized epidemic in Prism         phase[93][95].         Many who pushed past their limits are now incurably hollow, which         has a chilling effect on the community. Practitioners realize there         is a point of no return. This forces a philosophical crisis:         Hollowing isn’t just physical exhaustion; it’s described as         “when a user’s conviction fails catastrophically”, a         soul-level burnout[89].         So factions start placing more emphasis on mental training, belief         systems, or anything to keep conviction strong. For example:
            *         
Structuralist leadership doubles down on         ideology of order to keep their members’ conviction high         (convincing them that their cause of perfection is worth any cost,         so they won’t mentally break).
            *         
Continuists preach self-care and taking         shifts to avoid anyone losing themselves entirely – their open,         collaborative approach actually gives them resilience, as burden is         shared.
            *         
Releasers accept Hollowing almost as a         natural thing for those who resist ends; they take in some Hollows         into care, though they can’t cure them.
            *         
A subplot in         Novella 4 involves investigating the Hollowing cases, confirming         they are irreversible and not a disease that can be cured by healing         – this underscores that it’s a limit of the magic itself,         not just an injury[97][98].
            *         
Anti-Soulpulse         Technology – The Sanitists: Prism phase sees the rise of those         who fear or resent the chaos magic has brought. Referred to as         Sanitists (a movement or perhaps a government-backed group),         they begin developing suppression technology to control or         nullify Soulpulse[101][102].         Hints of this tech appear – devices that emit a dissonant field or         use some property of lattice dust to “jam” resonance. By the end         of N04, this technology is nearly ready (Chekhov’s gun for N05).         In story, perhaps the protagonists become aware that certain areas         dampen their powers slightly, or they find schematics for a device         that could globally silence the veins. This is the mundane world’s         response to the extraordinary: a very forge-punk solution of         “build a machine to tame the magic.” It represents the         crystallization of non-practitioner fear and the potential for an         external check on magic-users.
            *         
Emotional         and Social Prism: True to the name “Prism,” this phase         refracts the cast of characters emotionally. Each main character         faces their personal truth under pressure:
            *         
Jhace nearly dies from pushing himself         (Hollowing almost claims him) and through that humbling experience,         he learns to respect limits and interdependence[103][104].         By the finale of N04 he has grown, finding a sustainable way to use         his powers (even discovering a minor self-healing technique for his         lingering injuries)[103][105].
            *         
Tiffani reveals more of her secret knowledge         and must confront the burden of it – she partially confesses to         Jhace that she had special training, bridging some of the trust         gap[17][106].         She faces guilt for not sharing everything and the physical toll of         dual-use (her vein-burn scar on her arm grows from 3.5 cm to 4.2 cm,         a small detail indicating the cost of her saving Jhace[107][108]).         Emotionally she’s relieved that Jhace still trusts her despite         mysteries[98][109].
            *         
Corlexi (Visionary) essentially becomes a         fallen idol – his collapse shatters the myth that one         principle (Form) alone can save Te’Oga. His followers are         disillusioned or frightened, and some interpret his catatonic state         as a sign that something bigger is trying to birth through         him (which foreshadows his eventual transformation in N05).
            *         
Mobel (Purity zealot) in this phase likely         goes from quiet to radical. By now he’s probably split from the         Structuralists after seeing them as too compromising, and has         gathered a small cult of like-minded purificationists. Possibly an         event like him confronting a corrupt official and “cleansing”         them publicly happens, marking Purity’s violent emergence. The         Prism theme of fragmentation is at play: Purity splits off into its         own open movement by the end of this stage, even if smaller than         others.
Overall, Prism phase is about clarity through division. Each color of the magic spectrum now shines separately: the world sees what pure Form obsession leads to, what pure Mercy can do, how pure Purity manifests, etc. It’s beautiful in achievements (the tower lifting, dual magic healing) but also deadly (the tower collapse, hollowings, fanatic violence). By conclusion of Novella 4, the world has stabilized its infrastructure (~90% grid restored[110]) but at the cost of stability in other areas: political and spiritual tensions are at a breaking point. Everyone is bracing for an impending showdown of ideologies and powers, which arrives in the final phase.
Confluence/Fathom Phase – The Ultimate Union and the Breaking of Reality (Novella 5, “Confluence”, culminating in the Fathom Break)
The final phase brings everything to a head. Confluence refers to the combining of all four principles, and the Fathom Break is the apocalyptic event that results from that unprecedented resonance overload. Key developments:
               *         
All-Out Conflict and Weaponization: At         the start of this phase, open war erupts between factions         (particularly the authoritarian Purity faction and an alliance of         Continuists & remaining Structuralist moderates led by Jhace and         Tiffani). Soulpulse is now fully weaponized on the battlefield:
               *         
Purity warriors under Mobel (now openly         declaring only the “Pure” shall rule) use blinding white Purity         flames that burn living and non-living matter deemed         impure[111][112].         They employ horrifying tactics like extracting impurities from         opponents (which in practice can rip out vital essences or cause         internal hemorrhage)[37].
               *         
Continuity healers and Wholeness fighters         form protective choirs, linking their energies to shield         comrades from dissonance and rapidly heal injuries in the middle of         combat[113][16].         This is the first large-scale use of group harmonic resonance in         combat, and it proves effective but taxing.
               *         
Form resonators raise fortifications on the         fly – walls of earth or crystal summoned to block attacks[114].         Jhace himself cycles through multiple principles rapidly: shielding         allies with Wholeness, raising barriers with Form, nullifying a         poison gas with Purity, and destabilizing an enemy siege engine with         Entropy in quick succession[113][16].         This adaptability astonishes those around him, showing a hint of         Confluence potential even before it fully manifests.
               *         
Entropy users in combat act as saboteurs and         sappers: making enemy weapons brittle, sapping enemy morale (some         Entropy adepts learned to project a sense of despair onto foes, an         emotional resonance attack). They also mercifully take dying         soldiers out of suffering when needed, an understated but crucial         role.
               *         
Pulse-sense         and Tethering: By now, elite fighters developed the skill to         sense opponents’ resonance – essentially a sixth sense of         where and what type of magic the enemy is about to use, by feeling         the vibrations in the air. Duels become mind-games of feints and         frequency shifts. The concept of tethering emerges strongly:         some combatants learn to “tether” onto an enemy’s pulse,         either to disrupt it or to ride it. For instance, a Wholeness         fighter might latch onto a Purity user’s frequency briefly to         soften the impact of their next blast (a risky maneuver akin to         catching a wave at its peak). Conversely, Purity users might tether         to an opponent to inject a burst of dissonance directly, effectively         stealing their resonance momentarily and leaving the target         powerless. The battlefield becomes a web of these unseen tethers and         clashing fields.
               *         
Suppression         Device and the Fathom Break: The critical turning point is the         activation of the Sanitist Suppression Device[115][116].         This device, deployed by anti-magic authorities who fear the         escalating war, is meant to dampen all Soulpulse activity         within a large radius and “steal the fire” from the combatants.         However, its functioning is fundamentally flawed – it blankets the         area (and perhaps the planetary vein network) in a dissonant         counter-frequency. Instead of calming the conflict, it triggers the         nightmare scenario: “Steal Breaks Open.” This is a         catastrophic chain reaction where the suppression field causes the         planetary veins to rupture under pressure[117][118].         All the built-up resonance (from months of heavy use and the current         battle) that was meant to be dampened is suddenly unleashed in one         colossal wave. Reality itself destabilizes: the ground quakes         stop (like an eerie silence before a bigger storm)[119][120],         then a massive multi-colored omni-resonant shockwave erupts         from the ground and sky as the energy escapes every         conduit[21][121].
Simultaneously, in that moment, Jhace experiences ultimate loss – Tiffani sacrifices herself to save him from falling debris, dying in his arms[122][123]. His grief and love unlock something unprecedented: Confluence. Jhace’s soul, in agony, grabs onto all four principles at once instinctively and he unleashes a four-principle Soulpulse outburst[20][21]. This human Confluence merges with the wild surge triggered by the device failure, creating the event known as Fathom Break. The term has multiple meanings: it “breaks” the fathomable limits of magic (going beyond what anyone thought possible), it occurs deep in the “fathoms” of the world’s energy, and it literally breaks the world to some extent.
The effects are mythic and apocalyptic: a blinding pillar of energy punches into the sky[124]; all four colors of resonance intertwine in the blast (gold, blue, white, gray) – witnesses later describe it as if the song of creation itself roared out in discord then harmony. The shockwave travels through the veins of Te’Oga, awakening latent resonance everywhere at once. The immediate battlefield is leveled, but more remarkably, the shockwave triggers distant, simultaneous transformations: - Corlexi, recovering from his earlier Hollowing in a distant city, is hit by the wave of Confluence. The dormant potential in him (Form) is catalyzed and he transforms into Xilcore, the god-form of Structure[125][35]. - Salee (Leesa), Mobel (Blemo), and Eries (Seeri) undergo their respective god-ascensions at that exact moment as well[50][40][59]. Four human vessels, each aligned to one principle, simultaneously absorb the tsunami of resonance and become something more than human. This is the Confluence of all principles in the world, distributed into four focal points. No human had ever wielded all four at once until Jhace’s grief-driven burst, and that act literally created gods by giving those who embodied each principle an infinite charge of their resonance.
Meanwhile, physically, the world cracks: the extreme energy breaks off a chunk of the planet’s crust, levitating a whole region into the air[126]. The phenomenon of gravity faltering and land floating is entirely new – reality’s rules bent by omni-resonance. It causes mass destruction: cities are devastated by quakes ending abruptly then pieces of land flying up; thousands die in the chaos[126][127]. This is the disastrous price of the Fathom Break. In essence, it was as if the resonance field of the entire planet “rang” at full volume, then shattered like glass from the strain.
                  *         
Aftermath – Omni-Resonance and a         Transformed World: In the wake of the Fathom Break, nothing is         the same. The immediate effects include:
                  *         
Vein-network changes: The chronic         “vein-shatter” earthquakes that had plagued Te’Oga since         Piercing finally cease (the built-up pressure is         released)[119][120].         But in exchange, the very layout of the land is altered – there’s         talk of a chunk of landmass hovering or blasted upward[127],         likely remaining as an airborne isle or scattering as fallout.
                  *         
Lattice Dust 2.0: Perhaps a second         wave of lattice dust settles, now imbued with traces of all four         resonances. This dust might be even stranger – maybe glowing in         shifting colors, and it certainly cements that magic is here to stay         in the environment.
                  *         
Birth of Gods: Four individuals now         effectively assume roles as new deities, each radiating one         principle in pure form. They are called God-Vessels or         God-Aspects[128].         They immediately become rallying symbols: people flock to Xilcore         for order, to Leesa for healing and comfort, to Blemo out of fear or         fanaticism, and to Seeri for enlightenment or escape[129][130].         The Era of Gods begins in Te’Oga’s narrative[131][132].         This has huge social impact: existing factions polarize into         ideologies around these beings (e.g., Structuralists effectively         become Law devotees under Xilcore, Continuists become Mercy         followers under Leesa, etc.)[133][132].         Traditional governments and guild authority crumble as divine rule         (or resistance to it) takes over human affairs.
                  *         
Jhace’s Unique Position: Jhace         survived at ground zero, protected perhaps by being at the eye of         the storm (or maybe by Tiffani’s final shielding and the peculiar         nature of Confluence emanating from him rather than hitting         him). He emerges as the only mortal who channeled all principles         and lived – not ascended to godhood, but changed. He is often         described in the aftermath as emanating a faint aura of         Confluence[134][135];         he can inadvertently use any principle now in small ways, which         makes people fear or revere him. Emotionally, he’s devastated by         Tiffani’s death, but this pain steels his resolve to prevent the         new “gods” from making the world their pawn[131][136].         He becomes the de facto leader of those humans who don’t want to         worship the new pantheon. In magical terms, one could say Jhace         became a Confluence resonator – not always actively         wielding all four, but with the potential to align with any as         needed. He’s essentially a living bridge between the principles, a         role that might be pivotal in any future beyond the Chronicles.
                  *         
Reality’s         Fabric: The term “Fathom Slip” comes into use after the         Fathom Break to describe smaller scale anomalies that occur as a         result of the big event. Reality’s fabric got torn; in certain         locations or moments, people experience “slips” – gravity         reversing for a second, a person phasing partially into a ghostly         state and back, sudden language resonance (people speaking but         others hearing different words) – all signs that the boundary         between the four principle energies and the mundane world is thin or         unstable. Some practitioners who survived the Break report feeling         as if their resonance is no longer limited to one principle         at times – but those who try to seize that power         (mini-Confluences) often suffer Fathom Slips: they lose         themselves briefly in a transcendent state and come back broken or         not at all. Essentially, Confluence (omni-resonance) remains         extremely dangerous for anyone except perhaps Jhace. The world         itself occasionally “slips” into Confluence-like states         unpredictably, likely as a side effect of the vein-network         restructuring.
                  *         
Mythic and         Spiritual Transformation: The Fathom Break quickly enters         legend. It’s viewed as a semi-divine event: a combination of human         emotion, cosmic energy, and hubristic technology ripping open         creation. Different groups have their interpretation – the devout         say the old gods or the world-spirit chose new vessels that day; the         skeptics see it as a terrible accident of magic; the philosophers         call it the inevitable “next step” in resonance evolution (thus         Confluence Chronicles). The term “Fathom” itself gets         philosophical meaning: to fathom is to understand deeply, and         on that day, humanity briefly understood – and touched –         the deep heart of the world’s magic, and it was too much. It broke         what we thought was reality. But from that break, a new reality is         forged where mortals and gods, magic and life, are forever changed.
In summary, the Confluence/Fathom phase is the grand climax where the hard rules of the system meet an overpowering event. It serves as both the ultimate expression of the magic (all its pieces operating together) and a reset button on the world’s status quo. The magic system “goes out with a bang,” showing that even a meticulously developed system has catastrophic edges when taken to exponential levels, but also seeding the future: in the new world, this system will underpin a society of gods and those who resist them, with Soulpulse at the center of mythology, technology, and every aspect of life.
Laws, Limitations, and Failure States of Soulpulse
By the end of the Chronicles, practitioners have codified several laws and limits governing Soulpulse use, as learned through painful experience. The system, though fantastical, follows consistent rules – breaking them has specific failure modes. Here we enumerate the key limitations and what happens when things go wrong:
                     *         
Law of         Attunement: Resonance must be matched, not forced. If a         user tries to impose their will without syncing frequencies, they         will inevitably generate dissonance. This law underpins all         safe use of Soulpulse. The failure state when violated is immediate         vein-burn – the user’s veins and nerves feel like they’re         on fire as the energy clashes[43][6].         Externally, one might see their vein pathways glow angrily (often         the color of their resonance) and sometimes slight charring on skin         over major “vein” lines. Vein-burn can range from mild (a         temporary ache, slight tremor) to severe (long-term nerve damage,         scarring). Repeated infractions lead to cumulative vein scarring;         for instance, Jhace’s persistent hand tremor and burn scar are         legacies of earlier overuse[106][137].         This limitation ensures that learning attunement is the first step         for any trainee – many instructors’ first lesson is simply         “Listen. Don’t force.” which encapsulates this law.
                     *         
Law of         Conservation of Will: The strength of a Soulpulse effect is         limited by the user’s conviction (will and energy) and their         acceptance of cost. This emerged as an understanding that you         cannot get more than you give. Trying to achieve an effect beyond         your conviction or stamina results in Hollowing if attempted         repeatedly[89].         Hollowing is the terminal failure state where the user’s “soul         well” of energy and confidence runs dry[89].         Symptoms include tremors, the appearance of dull gray veins (no more         glow – the channels are “dead”), a vacant stare, and an         inability to spark any resonance at all[89].         It is irreversible; essentially the magic user’s spirit has         broken. Hollowing occurs not from one mistake but from exceeding         safe capacity repeatedly[89]         – it’s burnout incarnate, often due to overwork or obsession         (e.g., pushing daily to lift more than one should, or holding a         resonance far too long and often). One can think of it as the         resonance equivalent of heart failure after chronic stress. The law         teaches moderation and self-care: rest, emotional centering, and         knowing when to stop are literally lifesaving practices.
                     *         
Law of         Diminishing Echoes: After using Soulpulse, residual echoes         persist; reusing power too soon compounds risk. The presence of         vein-echo means that back-to-back casting without rest is         dangerous[23].         This law gives rise to the practice of spacing out high-intensity         magic or alternating among team members to let echoes dissipate. The         failure mode of ignoring this is Echo Stacking, leading to         unpredictable interference or self-dissonance spikes.         Essentially, if a practitioner slings multiple spells in rapid         succession, the leftover vibration from the last use skews the next         use’s frequency. Best case, the second attempt just fizzles or is         weaker. Worst case, it backfires dramatically – for         instance, a healer who rapidly jumps to a second patient without         recovering might find their energy “stutters” and injures rather         than heals, or a builder raising two walls in a row might cause the         second wall to shatter as the lingering resonance from the first         wall interacts chaotically. The remedy is to take a breath         (literally and figuratively) and re-center one’s frequency.         Advanced users learned techniques to “clear” echoes, like         grounding themselves by touching earth or using a tuning mantra         between tasks.
                     *         
Law of         Sympathy: To affect something via Soulpulse, you must accept         a two-way connection. This law reflects that resonance is a         dialogue. The Identity/Sympathy Bleed phenomenon is the risk         when this law is taken to extremes. If a practitioner fully opens         themselves to a target (especially a living one) without caution,         they experience Identity Bleed – a blurring of self-other         boundaries[46].         In minor form, this means strong empathy or lingering mood changes         after healing someone (healer takes on sadness or pain that isn’t         originally theirs). In major form, Sympathetic Overload         occurs: the practitioner gets “stuck” in the target’s resonant         feedback, potentially losing their own identity or physical         autonomy[47].         They might mimic the target’s injuries or emotional state         dangerously. The failure state can be coma or psychological break if         not interrupted. To prevent this, healers and connection-based users         employ grounding techniques – e.g., having a partner keep a hand         on their shoulder (a tactile reminder of self), or using personal         tokens that anchor their identity. Ethically, this law also spawned         debates: if you heal someone, you invariably take a piece of their         suffering. Is it right to do so? Many Continuists say “yes, that         is our gift and burden,” whereas more conservative healers seek         ways to minimize the bleed (like channeling excess into lattice dust         or objects). But fundamentally, to touch another’s soul, you         must let them touch yours – there’s no one-way use of         Soulpulse.

Law of         Material Resonance: The more rigid or complex a structure,         the more precise the required frequency – and the harsher the         backlash if done wrong. This was gleaned from how simple tasks         (like heating water or soothing pain) were relatively forgiving,         whereas complex tasks (like reinforcing a large building or altering         a living body) were not. Failure states related to this law include         Resonance Cascade for complex structures[10]         and Vein-Snap for pushing too hard on rigid materials[25].         Essentially, highly ordered systems (like a crystal lattice in         glass, or a human’s intricate physiology) have many interdependent         frequencies; to resonate them safely, one must hit a chord, not just         a single note. If one brute-forces a single frequency, you set off a         cascade – parts of the system resonate correctly, others violently         oppose, and the whole thing can collapse. We saw this in the Prism         tower incident: multiple frequency nodes in the structure got out of         sync and the whole tower fell apart[94].         For the user, trying to resonate a very stiff structure too         aggressively leads to vein-snap (their own channels rupture         under the strain, as the material “pushes back” on their         pulse)[25].         The practical upshot of this law is that large-scale or complex         workings require either multiple synchronized practitioners (to         cover all the needed frequencies in harmony) or a very slow, careful         tuning process. It’s why one person can’t just magically fix a         city in a day – the complexity would kill them. It enforced a kind         of specialization and teamwork in the system.
                     *         
Confluence         Limit (The Law of Four): No mortal mind can fully wield all         four principles at once without extraordinary circumstance. This         was more a presumed law until Jhace broke it, but even afterward, it         holds true for everyone else. Attempting omni-resonance is         beyond normal human capacity. Those who flirted with it (say,         someone trying to combine three principles after hearing of Jhace’s         feat) typically suffer Fathom Slip. Fathom Slip is a term         describing the failure state when a user is partially drawn into         that omni-resonant state but cannot control it – their         consciousness “slips” into the fathomless depth of the         collective resonance and they might lose touch with reality.         Symptoms can include speaking in tongues (random words from         different resonance “voices”), physical dislocation (one healer         vanished for several seconds as if phasing out of reality after         trying to channel Wholeness and Form and a hint of Purity in a         single ritual), or mental breakdown akin to a schizophrenic episode         (as the mind cannot reconcile the contradictory impulses of multiple         principles – e.g., feeling absolute compassion and absolute         judgment at the same time). After the Fathom Break, smaller Fathom         Slips also occur spontaneously in hotspots of high residual magic,         affecting even non-practitioners briefly (for example, a person         walking through a former battlefield might feel one with the         universe for a minute, then horribly alone the next – a micro         Confluence and crash). The existence of Fathom Slips essentially         underscores that Confluence is incredibly dangerous and         presumably only someone with extreme emotional drive (like Jhace’s         grief) or perhaps a unique nature (some hint Jhace might be special)         could survive it. For everyone else, “don’t try this at home”         is the rule – Confluence is considered a one-in-a-billion event,         not a new skill to master. This law humbles even the most ambitious         mages: there is a ceiling, and it’s god-level resonance which         humans can’t breach safely.
                     *         
Law of         Equivalent Exchange (Cultural): While not a scientific law per         se, by the end many practitioners adopt a rule of thumb – “The         Pulse gives as it takes.” If you want to achieve a great         effect, be prepared to pay a great cost. This is drawn from all the         above specific rules and simply encapsulates that limitation is         built into the magic. One cannot circumvent cost; one can only         decide what to sacrifice (health, energy, parts of oneself) for the         result. This became almost a moral law in guild teachings and among         responsible users, to ward off reckless attempts. When someone tried         to push too far, an elder might warn: “Remember the lattice:         strain it too much and it cracks – and so will you.”
Understanding these laws allowed users to push Soulpulse to incredible heights while (mostly) avoiding fatal errors. But as the chronicles show, every law was learned by someone reaching or exceeding it. The magic system, being hard and rule-bound, rewarded those who respected these limits – and punished those who didn’t.
Integration with Forge-Punk / Glass-Punk Aesthetic
Soulpulse magic did not exist in a vacuum; it intertwined with Te’Oga’s technological and aesthetic backdrop, which is often described as forge-punk / glass-punk. This world features technology centered on metallurgy, glasswork, and thermal energy (the “heat-grid”), all of which became canvases for resonance magic. The integration of magic with this pseudo-industrial setting produced a unique cultural and visual aesthetic:
                        *         
Heat and         Friction as Themes: The language of forging and friction is         frequently used to describe Soulpulse. When frequencies clash, it’s         “friction heat” that one feels – a very concrete sensation for         blacksmiths who know the burn of a too-hot forge. Conversely,         successful attunement is described like a well-tempered blade: it         resonates with a clear tone instead of sparking. Because Te’Oga’s         pre-magic industry was based on heat, many early analogies         for using Soulpulse likened it to controlling heat. Practitioners         thought of their will as flame to be tempered. For example, Jhace         initially tried to “hammer” a fix, applying will like brute         heat, and failed; Tiffani showed him the glassmaker’s approach         of slow annealing (gradual heating and cooling), which         succeeded[13][138].         This fostered a hybrid mindset: successful magic became about         balancing passion (heat) with precision (cooling).         Forge-punk visuals—sparks, glow, steam—accompanied many         Soulpulse workings as people often used actual forges or tools to         focus their will. It was common to see a smith-magician at a ruined         metal beam, heating it with a normal forge flame while also singing         into it with Soulpulse, combining mundane and magical heat to get         the perfect resonance.
                        *         
Glass         Resonance and “Memory”: Glass, being both fragile and a         product of fire (sand transmuted by flame), held special         significance. The glass-punk aspect is evident in how glass         was used as a medium for magic. Glass has a property often called         “glass memory” in this world: if cooled improperly, it retains         stress that can cause it to shatter later. This became a powerful         metaphor for Soulpulse – any resonant change must be “cooled”         correctly (i.e., eased out gently) or else the effect may fail         catastrophically later. Tiffani demonstrated this when repairing         proof-walls: she would anneal cracked glass slowly rather than         force a quick fix, resulting in a stable mend, whereas a hurried         fix would have shattered shortly after[139][140].         Culturally, glass also became a recording medium for resonance.         Practitioners noticed that lattice-glass (glass infused with         lattice dust) would faintly glow or ring after certain spells, as if         echoing the magical frequency. This led to experiments in creating         “resonance records”: glass panes or beads that, once resonated         with a particular pattern, “remember” it and can replay a subtle         vibration on command. While not advanced enough to be true         computers, these memory-glasses served as early warning devices or         teaching tools (a student could hold a glass that “remembered”         the correct resonance for lifting water, feeling the subtle         vibration as a guide). The aesthetic of stained glass and crystals         permeated magical teaching; diagrams of resonance frequencies were         etched into glass tablets, and some Continuists carried glass chimes         to denote a safe healing space (the chime’s tone would confirm if         no harsh dissonance was around). Light refraction through         resonant glass became a motif – e.g., in Prism city, sun hitting         the unfinished grand tower created spectral colors, symbolic of         different principles. Post-Fathom, the use of colored glass to         represent each principle in art (blue Form, gold Wholeness, white         Purity, gray Entropy) became common in temples and guild banners.
                        *         
Mechanical         Integration: The existing technology of Te’Oga – furnaces,         gear systems, pumps for the heat-grid – gradually got retrofitted         or operated with Soulpulse assistance. This blending made the world         feel “forge-punk” in that steam and ironworks co-exist with         magical vibrations:
                        *         
Resonant Forges: Blacksmiths learned         to embed resonance chambers in their forges – essentially         hollow lattice-lined tubes that when hummed into, could evenly heat         metal via vibrational energy. This let them do precision heating         that a normal coal fire couldn’t, giving rise to superior alloys         that were magically stress-relieved (no internal flaws).
                        *         
Glass Foundries: Glassmakers started         using resonance to fine-tune their melts. For instance, they would         emit a gentle Continuity pulse while cooling large panes, preventing         micro-cracks (the pulse “held the glass together” as it         settled). The result was “pulse-proofed” glass –         ironically far sturdier than before, used in new proof-walls that         could withstand more strain.
                        *         
The Heat-Grid: The heat-grid was a         network of geothermal taps and pipes distributing heat to cities.         Post-Piercing, many pipes were broken. Practitioners not only         repaired them with Soulpulse welding, they also innovated: some         Continuity resonators managed to create a self-healing conduit         – by embedding a constant low-level resonance in the grid, it         could adjust pressure and seal small leaks on the fly. Essentially,         they gave the grid a rudimentary “pulse” of its own to maintain         itself. Forge-punk imagery here is a huge brass pipe humming with         aheartbeat-like thrum as hot water flows – alive in a way.
                        *         
Gadgets and         Vehicles: While the chronicles don’t explicitly mention         vehicles, one can imagine that carts or elevators might be powered         by resonance engines, especially after things stabilize. For         example, an inventor might create a resonance gear – a         rotating device that, when a practitioner infuses a frequency,         converts it to mechanical motion. This could operate a lift or a         pulley system without steam or beasts. The visual would be a cage         lift in a mine that runs silently except for a faint hum and glow         from its resonance gear, overseen by a Dissolution resonator who         ensures it stops softly by damping vibrations at the end of travel.
                        *         
Alloy         Metaphors and Cultural Lexicon: The “alloy” concept –         combining different materials or ideas to make something stronger –         became ingrained in how people spoke of Soulpulse. The early         partnership of forge and glass guilds set the tone: “We must         alloy our strengths” became a saying, meaning combine         differing approaches for synergy. Post-factions, some idealists         called themselves “Alloys” meaning they embraced         multi-disciplinary magic or philosophy, not sticking to one faction         – these were often mediators or the rare multi-resonant         individuals carrying multiple traditions. The concept of alloy also         influenced magical crafting: attunement items like tools or         weapons were literally alloyed from special metals plus lattice dust         and sometimes bits of crystal, representing the union of craft and         magic. One legendary example is a sword forged by a team of all         three faction smiths – steel alloyed with glass and lattice dust –         quenched in a healer’s blood. It supposedly could “cut on the         fault lines of anything,” essentially resonating to find the         weakest structural frequency of a target. Such mythic items aside,         more common were resonant alloys used for currency (see next         section) and building. City architects after N04 insisted on mixing         a bit of each faction’s materials – metal, glass, ash (symbolic         of entropy) – into new construction as both a symbolic and         practical measure (structures literally incorporating aspects of all         principles seemed more stable, at least culturally, as it encouraged         multi resonant maintenance teams).
                        *         
Visual and         Sensory Palette: The integration yields a world of striking         visuals: Streets with copper pipes and glass tubing along buildings,         all dusted by a glittering coat of lattice dust that catches light.         By day, you see workshop yards where smiths hammer glowing metal         that sings with each strike (because a resonator is timing pulses         with the hammer blows). By night, the cities are lit by         “pulse-lamps” – originally gas or oil lamps now augmented with         a small crystal that glows when a resonator hums (some areas have a         person walk the street humming at lamps to light them). There’s a         mix of old soot and new sparkle: forge smoke and steam still exist,         but often you’ll see it disturbed by odd patterns (vibrations from         nearby magic use ripple the smoke into rings). The populace attire         also reflects this meld: people still wear practical leather aprons         or furnace goggles, but maybe now those goggles have tinted         resonance glass lenses to help see magical auras; healers still         carry satchels of herbs, but alongside tuning forks or humming         stones. Even language: curses and expletives evolved – a         frustrated engineer might yell “By the cracked lattice!” whereas         a blessing might be “May your pulse stay in tune.” The identity         of artisans shifted – a glassblower may simultaneously be known as         a Continuity resonator; a blacksmith might also be a Structural         “binder.”
In summary, Soulpulse’s hard rules and ethereal nature were grounded in the physical crafts of Te’Oga. Magic became another tool in the toolbox of the industrial arts – albeit a transformative one. The forge-punk/glass-punk aesthetic ensured that while magic advanced what was possible, it did so in a way that felt like a natural outgrowth of the world’s existing character: fiery, hand-crafted, innovative, and just a bit gritty. The result is a culture where a workshop might double as a spell laboratory, and the line between technician and mage is blurred into the new archetype of the resonance craftsman.
Resonant Crafting and Economic Systems
The rise of Soulpulse reshaped Te’Oga’s economy and crafts, giving birth to new materials, tools, and even forms of currency. The concept of value began to entwine with resonance: items that could hold or channel Soulpulse became highly prized. Here we explore how crafting and commerce evolved:
                           *         
Soulpulse Tools and Instruments: As         practitioners refined their skills, they designed specialized         tools to aid in resonance work. Early on, simple things like         metal tuning forks, chimes, or drums were used to produce reference         tones for training attunement (a set of tuning forks each calibrated         to frequencies that matched common materials – wood, iron, glass –         became standard in workshops). Over time, more sophisticated         instruments emerged:
                           *         
Resonance Calipers: Imagine a caliper         device inlaid with lattice dust that, when clamped on a material,         emits a subtle vibration indicating its natural frequency (via a         gauge or a note). These helped craftsmen quickly find the right         “note” to work on a given piece of metal or stone.
                           *         
Vein Scanners: A medical tool created         by healer-artisans, consisting of a small glass lens and crystal         that can be passed over a body; it resonates slightly with the         person’s pulse and reveals areas of blockage or trauma as         different colored glows (essentially an MRI by magic). This improved         diagnostic ability and became a staple for Continuity healers.
                           *         
Attunement Foci: Items that help focus         or amplify one’s resonance. These included things like         lattice-engraved gauntlets for Structuralists (allowing them         to channel Form pulses more stably into constructions) or singing         bowls for Entropy adepts (they would run a mallet around a         bowl’s rim to produce a low hum that guided their dissolution         spells). Many practitioners carried personal foci akin to wands or         staves in other fantasy – except these were custom-made from         metals and glass that resonated with their frequency. A Wholeness         resonator, for example, might have a copper and crystal glove         that gently vibrates at her healing frequency, making it easier to         enter that state and also protecting her from some sympathetic         feedback.
                           *         
Forge-Punk         War Devices: The militarization led to engineered weapons that         combine physical design with resonance. One such example is the         “Pulse Bow” – a crossbow fitted with a resonant crystal         such that when fired, the bolt carries a vibrational charge (on         impact it delivers a concussive pulse, bypassing armor). Another is         “Tether Nets” – weighted nets with interwoven lattice         dust; when a Dissolution pulse is sent through them, they emit a         field that can suppress a caught mage’s ability to concentrate (a         non-lethal anti-mage tool used by some authorities).
                           *         
Lattice         Dust Economy: Lattice dust, initially a nuisance, quickly turned         into a valuable resource once its properties were understood.         This fine glittering dust (essentially crystallized magical residue)         was found to:
                           *         
Enhance materials when infused (like making         glass stronger or metal more receptive to resonance).
                           *         
Serve as a catalyst in many crafting recipes         (like an alchemical reagent).
                           *         
Be a baseline for currency due to its uniform         presence and slight inherent energy.
Early on, people tried using lattice dust as currency directly – the phrase “dust trade” emerged as scavengers collected dust to sell to artisans who needed it for forging. However, dust by itself is messy and easy to falsify (mix with sand, etc.). Thus, Pulse-imbued currency was developed. The government mints (or what remained of them) in conjunction with Structuralist artificers created coins that contained a measured quantity of lattice dust alloyed with metal. These coins, sometimes called “Resonance Marks” or informally “Sparks”, had a unique feature: when rung (say by tapping on a counter) or lightly resonated, a genuine coin emits a clear, specific tone that’s hard to replicate. This acted as a built-in anti-counterfeiting measure[28] (the idea being only a true coin with the right lattice content will sing the right note, and any impurity yields a dull or wrong sound). Traders became adept at “ringing” coins and listening for the correct resonance. It’s analogous to how people bite gold coins – here they’d flick a coin and trust their ear for the pure tone.
Over time, as guilds fell and new orders rose, different regions tried different currency systems. Some communities went full barter, trading magical services. But as stability returned, a standardized pulse-backed currency gained traction: essentially a paper note or token that corresponded to an amount of resonance charge. Continuist bankers (ever collaborative) pioneered “pulse bonds” where a healer or resonator could store a bit of their energy in a special crystal and get a token representing that deposit, which others trust because it can be redeemed for actual resonant effect later (a very novel concept akin to energy banking). However, this remained local. The widely accepted currency remained the minted coins with lattice dust – they satisfied the old-world folk (metal coin) and new-world needs (resonance verifiability).
                              *         
Crafting of Attunement Items: Beyond         tools for the practitioners themselves, a new art form emerged:         attuned artifacts for everyday people. Crafters found that by         forging an item in the presence of a strong resonance, they could         imbue it with a subtle attunement. For example:
                              *         
Resonant Lamps: Glass orbs crafted         while a Wholeness resonator sang, which thereafter naturally glow a         soft light in the presence of human emotions (popular in homes as         mood-lighting or even security – if an intruder with hostile         intent enters, the lamp’s glow might falter or change color).
                              *         
Lattice Locks: City banks commissioned         locks infused with Form resonance such that they “harden” if         tampered with by anyone not attuned properly – the metal literally         stiffens and emits a shrill feedback if the wrong frequency touches         it (i.e. if someone tries to pick it without the matching resonant         key).
                              *         
Healing Crystals: Small pendants or         beads that had been attuned by Continuity mages to hold a charge of         soothing resonance. While not capable of true healing, a person in         pain could squeeze the bead and release a calming pulse to take the         edge off. These became popular merchandise, almost like the         equivalent of over-the-counter medicine.
                              *         
Entropy Charms: Conversely, little         sachets or tokens attuned by Releasers that could, for instance,         keep food from spoiling (by subtly accelerating and completing         micro-decay processes of anything that started rotting, effectively         desiccating and preserving the food). These charms found use in         trade caravans, acting like magical preservatives.
                              *         
Purity         Wards: Rare but valued in places like hospitals or sanctuaries –         ceramics or glass pieces created with Purity resonance present,         which naturally resist stains and bacteria (microorganisms find it         hard to survive near them). While Mobel’s faction caused terror,         some benevolent Purity users put their gift into crafting such wards         to maintain sterile environments or keep water supplies clean.
                              *         
Guilds to         Guildless Craft Economy: Before Soulpulse, craft guilds (forge         guild, glass guild, etc.) controlled production and economic life.         The introduction of resonance threw that into chaos. As described,         guild authority collapsed around N02-N03[76].         Instead, factions and independent workshops took over. For a         time, the economy was fractured: Structuralist-controlled cities         enforced licensed crafting (only those approved by their hierarchy         could sell resonant goods), whereas Continuist zones were like         freewheeling markets of ideas where anyone might hawk a new clever         attuned gadget. This led to a boom in innovation but also         inconsistency in quality. By the post-Confluence era, the landscape         likely shifts again with divine influences: e.g., in Xilcore’s         territory, crafts probably re-organize under strict standards and         divine blessings (a sort of resurgent guild system under a god’s         purview), while in Leesa’s lands, production might be more         cooperative and need-based.
One notable economic institution was the Resonant Forge Collegium started in late N04: a neutral forum where craft-workers of all resonance affinities met to share techniques and set some safety standards (like, no selling hollowing-inducing “boost” potions, or agreeing on pricing for lattice dust to prevent bloodshed over it). It was an attempt to stabilize the economy that war would later disrupt, but some principles carried forward.
                                 *         
Resonance-imbued         Currency in Detail: To illustrate how currency became more than         just money: By N05, people realized that these lattice-dust coins         are also minor power sources. In a pinch, a practitioner         could grind down a coin and use the dust to strengthen a spell (like         using charcoal for a fire). This gives “spending money” a         literal twist – sometimes in battle or emergency, throwing a         handful of currency into a ritual was how you “spent” it.         Additionally, because each coin had a known resonance signature,         some clever traders developed resonant banknotes: a thin         metal strip in the note would resonate the coin’s tone when the         note was authenticated in a device. The average citizen might not         understand the physics but knew the practical: a fake coin had a         flat clink, a real one sang true. In parts of society, coin-checking         by resonance became a ritual at markets, almost a social music – a         bazaar full of pinging coin sounds, each stall owner checking         payments like tuning an instrument.
                                 *         
Alchemy and         Transmutation: With new materials (lattice dust, resonant         alloys), a proto-alchemical economy emerged. Recipes combining         traditional substances with resonance effects created products:         e.g., “Latticesteel”, an alloy of steel with trace dust         that is slightly self-repairing (if cracked, it fuses slowly under         heat – perfect for engine parts), or “Glow-ink”, a         concoction used by scribes that includes dust and when written with         a certain hum, the text glows or even moves (used for secret         missives or art). Such goods became lucrative trade items. The cost         to create them often required a practitioner’s touch plus         materials, so their price incorporated magical labor. A new class of         artisan – the resonant craftsman – could command high         fees, and guilds (or later, temples of the new gods) tried to         monopolize them. For example, by endgame, Xilcore’s followers         likely seized all production of latticesteel to outfit their armies,         while Blemo’s fanatics might hoard purification elixirs.
                                 *         
Cultural         Shift in Value: The infusion of magic did devalue some prior         commodities (e.g., pure metals alone might lose relative value         because now resonant metals are what people want). On the         other hand, completely new markets arose – “echo insurance”         (pay a Continuity resonator to clear your home of leftover         vibrations after a battle so your family doesn’t get sick from         them), or training schools offering to find your child’s affinity         for a fee. Knowledge itself became a currency; manuals on resonance         techniques were treasured. One could trade a secret attunement         method for a chest of goods.
In essence, the economy became an alchemy of the mundane and magical. Traditional crafting did not vanish – you still needed to shape metal and blow glass – but Soulpulse added layers of value and complexity. Craftsmen who embraced resonance thrived, those who didn’t either found niche markets (perhaps touting “pure hand-made, no magic” goods for traditionalists) or faded. The concept of worth now often included the question, “Does it resonate?” A sword was fine, but a sword attuned to slice through a stone golem – that was priceless. Money quite literally talked through its tone. And the line between a product and a spell blurred, as everyday items carried enchantment and practitioners themselves became living economic assets due to their rarified skills.
Weaponization and Battlefield Applications of Soulpulse
Soulpulse fundamentally changed warfare on Te’Oga, introducing a new age of magical tactics and resonant weaponry. On the battlefield, resonance was as crucial as steel or strategy. Key aspects of its weaponization and combat use include:
                                    *         
Pulse-Sensing         and Reconnaissance: Skilled combat resonators developed a sort         of radar sense for magic. They could “feel” the         pulse-fields of other practitioners at a distance, especially if         those practitioners were actively using their power. This gave rise         to specialized scouts known as “Pulse-seekers.” These         individuals would meditate on the battlefield to detect enemy         resonances – for instance, sensing the telltale high-frequency         prickle of a squad of Form users fortifying an ambush ahead, or the         low thrum of Releasers lying in wait. Commanders increasingly relied         on pulse-sensing for intelligence: before engaging, they’d ask,         “what do your veins hear?” A well-trained Continuity resonator         could even differentiate resonance signatures (like identifying         Mobel’s distinctive piercing purity aura from among generic Purity         grunts). Countermeasures emerged too: some troops carried dissonance         jammers – essentially noise-makers (like wind-chimes or         rattles imbued with chaotic frequencies) to mask their presence from         pulse-sensors. Stealth in this era meant not just moving quietly,         but keeping one’s soul quiet.
                                    *         
Tether         Mechanics and Resonant Grappling: In combat, establishing a         tether became a known technique. A tether is a temporary         resonant link between a practitioner and a target. This could be         used offensively or defensively:
                                    *         
Offensive tethering: Purity and Form         users in particular excelled at this. A Purity fighter might latch a         tether onto an enemy mage’s veins – visualized as a thin thread         of white energy – and use it to inject a spike of dissonance,         essentially yanking the enemy’s frequency off-key to         disrupt their spell. This was called “severing the chord”         in slang. Form users could tether to an enemy’s weapon or armor         and send a rigid pulse that either locks it (making a sword suddenly         too heavy to swing) or shatters it by over-stabilizing         microfractures (like snapping something by making it too rigid).         Continuity resonators sometimes tethered to enemies in a bizarre         tactic to temporarily confuse them – a quick empathic tether that         floods the foe with the resonator’s own adrenaline or fear,         throwing them off balance.
                                    *         
Defensive tethering: Continuity and         Entropy users did this often. Continuity users could tether to         allies – sharing strength or distributing damage. In some battles,         when a warrior was mortally wounded, a Continuity mage tethered and         spread the injury across multiple willing allies, so no one         person died (each took a fraction of the damage, survivable, a grim         but effective rescue). They called this “sharing the bleed”.         Entropy users would tether to the environment – say the very air         or ground – to disperse harmful resonance. For example, if an         enemy launched a destructive pulse, a Dissolution adept might catch         it with a tether and channel it harmlessly into the earth, causing a         patch of ground to crack but sparing living soldiers.
                                    *         
Establishing a         tether often required line-of-sight and focus, so battle was full of         these mini-duels of people trying to latch onto each other’s         resonance while dodging physical attacks. It added an invisible         tug-of-war layer atop physical combat.
                                    *         
Sensory         Extension and Battlefield Awareness: Resonators learned to         extend their senses through their element via Soulpulse. An         earth-aligned Form user might send vibrations through the ground to         feel the positions of troops (like seismic sense). Continuity         users could link with local fauna or even the subtle bio-resonance         of terrain (e.g., sensing footsteps through grass vibrations). This         meant that ambushes became harder – you had to account for the         enemy possibly feeling you coming. In response, armies         employed resonant decoys: e.g., releasing small devices         emitting fake pulse signals to mislead sensors, or using slaughtered         animal parts imbued with a frequency to simulate a group of hidden         soldiers (grisly but it happened). Conversely, some commanders         exploited sensory extension – if they knew an enemy sensor was         scanning, they’d deliberately resonate an overwhelming noise (like         banging gongs imbued with chaotic frequencies) to effectively blind         the enemy’s magical senses.
                                    *         
Resonant         Weaponry and Armor: By N05, conventional arms were augmented by         Soulpulse engineering:
                                    *         
Melee Weapons: Swords and spears were         crafted with resonance channels – grooves or inlays that could         carry a practitioner’s pulse along the blade. A Form resonator’s         sword might stiffen or lengthen slightly on command (via a         structural pulse), turning a short sword into a rigid lance for a         thrust. A Purity knight’s blade might ignite in white flame when         he pours Purity resonance through it, cutting through enchanted         constructs with ease. Continuity warriors sometimes wielded         “Chain-blades”, segmented swords linked by resonance         fields that could extend like a whip (held together by the user’s         connecting pulse). Blunt weapons were popular for Entropy users –         a warhammer that upon impact delivers a decay pulse that makes armor         crumble or bones weaken.
                                    *         
Ranged Weapons: Traditional bows and         crossbows remained, but with added effects. Arrows tipped with         resonance crystals could explode in a burst of dissonance on impact         – not necessarily fiery, but like a concussive “pulse bomb”         that could knock a mage out of concentration[111][112].         There were also entropy darts that carried a sleeping         resonance to tranquilize targets (used by Releasers to minimize         suffering; some battles ended with entire platoons peacefully         knocked out rather than slaughtered).
                                    *         
Armor: Armorers integrated resonance         into defensive gear. Harmonic armor had lattice dust such         that if the wearer emitted a constant tone, the armor would resonate         and harden (absorbing more impact). Skilled defenders literally         hummed to reinforce their suits in battle. Shields were engraved         with Form sigils that could project temporary barriers (small-scale         proof-walls for a second or two). Some Continuity healers wore         “Veilweave” cloaks – fabric imbued with Wholeness         pulses that knit back together if torn and could even slowly         self-heal the wearer’s minor wounds mid-fight (though it drained         the cloak’s power).
                                    *         
Notably,         anti-magic armor also appeared: suits lined with materials         that create dissonance to any incoming pulse, essentially resonance         insulation. The Sanitists (anti-magic faction) developed         gauntlets and chestplates that gave regular soldiers a chance         against mages – for example, an insulated shield that, when a         pulse hit it, emitted an unpleasant feedback screech dispersing the         effect. These weren’t foolproof, but they leveled the field         slightly, at least until a clever mage found a workaround frequency.
                                    *         
Squad         Tactics and Formations: Armies created units composed of mixed         resonance types for combined arms tactics:
                                    *         
A frontline “Phalanx” might have         Structuralists in the center raising barriers and hardening allies’         armor, Continuity healers interspersed to mend and tether injuries,         Purity berserkers at the spear-tip punching holes with cleansing         flame, and Entropy “finishers” behind to safely deconstruct         enemy barriers and put down dying foes mercifully. These teams had         to train extensively to synchronize their pulses, effectively         learning to march and fight in resonance. A well-trained unit         sounded like an orchestra – literally, they often had a cadence or         chant they all kept to, maintaining a harmonic rhythm that bolstered         their combined powers.
                                    *         
The phrase “Find the note!” was         common in battle – meaning find the enemy’s frequency and         exploit it. For instance, if an enemy shield wall was resonating         with a defensive tone (maybe a Continuity chant bonding them),         opposing Purity troops would try to find a dissonant note to break         that harmony. Trumpeters or horn-blowers were used not just for         signals but to blast notes that might disrupt enemy resonance.         Battlefields at times sounded eerily like musical competitions, with         war-horns, shouted chants, clashing frequencies along with the clang         of steel.
                                    *         
Resonant         Signals: Communication in battle also improved with magic – a         Continuity mage could “tether” to a distant ally and relay         information empathically (not full speech, but a burst of feeling or         an image – enough to signal needs). This was the precursor to         telepathic communication. Some entropic “philosopher-soldiers”         served as battlefield coordinators by entering a meditative state         and linking minds across a unit, acting as a hub for transmitting         orders wordlessly (limited in range though).
                                    *         
Ethical and         Collateral Considerations: The use of Soulpulse in war raised         grim ethical questions. One tactic developed by crueler Purity         forces was resonance poisoning: introducing a subtle         dissonant frequency into an area’s environment so that anyone who         tried to use Soulpulse there would get vein-burn (effectively laying         magical minefields or booby traps). This made occupied towns         dangerous for local practitioners. Continuity healers protested such         tactics as inhumane. On the flip side, Continuity healers themselves         faced a dilemma: using their power offensively contradicted their         ethos, but many saw that by not fighting, they allowed worse         horrors. Some began using non-lethal resonance attacks (e.g.,         inducing unconsciousness or disarming rather than killing), but         against fanatics, that wasn’t always an option.
A notable moral issue was “grip and steal” – slang for a maneuver where one mage would restrain (grip) an enemy with resonance and another would steal their life by ripping out their entire vein-network or resonance (essentially execution via soul-tearing). This terrifying technique was rare but happened in the most vicious confrontations (particularly Purity zealots on captured Continuity healers or vice versa in moments of vengeance). It was widely condemned afterwards as a war crime equivalent.
                                       *         
Suppression and Nullification: The         ultimate weapon against magic users was the suppression field         created by the Sanitist device[115].         Though its catastrophic failure ended up empowering the enemy, the         concept remains: technology (or possibly certain Entropy rituals)         can dampen magic. On a small scale, some troops carried “Resonance         dampening grenades” – glass spheres that, when shattered,         released alchemical smoke laced with dissonant frequencies (mix of         lattice dust and specific chemicals). In the thick of battle, these         would create pockets where casting was painful or impossible until         the smoke cleared. They were used to counter heavy mage emplacements         or to cover retreats. It’s notable that in the final battle, the         detonation of the grand suppression device acted like an enormous         version of this – intended to nullify all magic, it ironically         unleashed more. After seeing that outcome, most armies would be wary         of large-scale suppression tech – it’s akin to using a nuke. But         portable dampeners remained a part of warfare, a constant         cat-and-mouse with magic.
In sum, warfare in the Soulpulse era became a multi-layered conflict: physical, psychological, and resonant. Every soldier had to be mindful not just of arrows and swords, but of frequencies in the air that could kill or save. Victory often went to those who coordinated their principles best – or who exploited the enemy’s resonant weaknesses. Battles were won by shattering the opposition’s harmony, literally causing their formations and morale to “fall out of tune.” The integration of Soulpulse made combat more unpredictable and devastating, but also allowed for creative strategies and mercy (like healing and non-lethal takedowns) that might have been impossible in mundane war. It was an era where a battle could be decided by a single resonant note, and legends were told of warriors who could “sing the enemy to his grave” or turn the tide with a harmonizing cry that “made the fractured ranks whole again.”
Terminology and Lived-In Field Language
Over the course of the Confluence Chronicles, the practitioners and common folk alike developed a rich slang and specialized vocabulary to describe their new reality. This lived-in language gives color to the world and reflects how deeply Soulpulse has embedded into culture. Below is a glossary of key terms and colloquialisms, with explanations and context:
                                          *         
Bleed /         Bleeder:
 Literal Meaning: The phenomenon of one’s         identity or energy spilling over into another, or the act of giving         of oneself (as in healing).
Usage: “Don’t         overextend, or you’ll start to bleed.” – Warning to         a healer about identity bleed[46].         “He’s one of the Bleeders.” – Reference to a         member of the Continuists, who were derogatorily nicknamed         “Bleeders”[141].
Context:         Initially, “bleed” described how Continuity resonators would         take on others’ pain or merge auras (their boundaries “bleeding”         together)[46].         It became a badge of honor among Continuists – they took the slur         “Bleeder” and owned it, implying they’re willing to bleed for         others. In everyday speech, “to bleed” could mean to give too         much: a mother fussing might say to her mage child, “I know you         want to heal everyone, but you can’t bleed yourself dry for         them.” Conversely, “bleed into” became a phrase meaning to         gradually influence or merge – e.g., a teacher’s style might         “bleed into” her students’ work, or two neighborhoods’         cultures might “bleed together.” It’s a gentle term, usually         positive when used by Continuists (signifying compassion), and         negative when used by Structuralists (signifying lack of discipline         or boundaries).
                                          *         
Echo:
 Literal         Meaning: Residual resonance left in a practitioner’s veins or         in the environment after magic use[23].
Usage:         “Hold on, I’ve got an echo in my head from that         last spell.” – A mage needing a moment before casting again.         “The halls of that ruin are full of echoes.” –         Explorer’s warning that magical residue lingers, possibly causing         weird phenomena.
Context: “Echo” is both technical         and colloquial. Technically, a vein-echo is the lingering         vibration post-casting that can interfere with subsequent magic[23].         Casters might say “I’m still echoing” to mean they haven’t         recovered yet. In slang, an “echo” can also refer to a person         who mindlessly imitates someone else’s ideas (like calling         someone’s yes-man an echo). This derived from the idea of an         unoriginal sound reverberating. Also, experiences could leave         “echoes” – e.g., after the war, veterans spoke of “battlefield         echoes” meaning trauma that resonated in them long after. The term         appears in phrases like “echo fade”, referring to the         necessary cooldown between spells (“Give it a minute for the echo         to fade”). And “echo chase” – a risky practice of         casting successively without rest, essentially chasing one’s own         echoes, usually admonished because it leads to accidents.
                                          *         
Tether:
 Literal         Meaning: A temporary resonant link or connection established         between a practitioner and a target (be it person or object).
Usage:         “I’ve tethered to his pulse – I can hold him,         but hurry!” – A Continuity mage restraining an enemy by         linking to them. “We tether in pairs, so nobody         drifts too far.” – Training advice for multi-resonant         exercises.
Context: The word “tether” traditionally         meant a rope or chain tying an animal. Magically, it captures the         idea of linking two frequencies like a rope joining two         souls. Tethers could be felt or even faintly seen by those         sensitive: often described as threads of light or feeling. It became         common to ask in a fight, “You got a tether on that one?”         meaning do you have that enemy under resonant grip. Among         Continuists, “tether me” was a request for support –         one healer asking another to keep them anchored during a heavy         sympathetic connection. In everyday metaphor, people used tether         too: a close friendship might be described as “they’re tethered         together,” or someone keeping another grounded emotionally might         be thanked with “you were my tether.” The darker use came with         suppression tech: “to tether” an area meant to blanket it with a         field tying down everyone’s resonance (as if chaining them). After         N05, “tether-fields” referred to local zones of lingering         combined resonance that one could get metaphorically stuck in,         called also Fathom Slips in extreme cases.
                                          *         
Grip:
 Literal         Meaning: The act of seizing or holding firm, both literally and         in terms of maintaining a resonant hold on something.
Usage:         “Find the grip that holds, and the rest will         follow.” – An idiom from early reconstruction, meaning find         the stabilizing element (physical or magical)[12].         “She gripped the frequency and bent it to her         will.” – Description of a Form mage taking control of a         structure’s vibration.
Context: “Grip” gained         special significance after Jhace’s legendary first act of heroism         – grabbing molten glass bare-handed to save Tiffani[142].         Stories of “the Grip That Holds” spread: it symbolized         determination and sacrifice. Thus “to grip” in magical jargon         came to mean to tenaciously hold onto a resonance or situation         despite pain. Practitioners talk about “getting a grip on”         a tough frequency as the moment they succeed in attunement. The         phrase “losing your grip” took on a double meaning: not         just mentally slipping, but also failing to maintain a spell or         resolve (if someone’s barrier fails, they might say “I lost my         grip on it”). The connotation is often positive when used to         praise resolve (“He kept a grip on that building’s resonance for         an hour so others could evacuate – amazing.”). “Grip” also         features in the common mantra, presumably taught by Tiffani, “Guide,         don’t grip” – reminding novices not to strangle the magic         with force but to guide it (some irony given the term, but it means         don’t hold too rigidly). Finally, “Gripsteel” became a         nickname for Jhace’s scarred hand among bards, suggesting it was         as strong as steel because he held the impossible.

Steal:
 Literal         Meaning: To take something that isn’t yours – in magic, to         strip another of their resonance or to nullify it covertly (as the         suppression device tried to do)[143].
Usage:         “They tried to steal our magic.” – Common         refrain about the Sanitist device failure[143].         “Watch out, that one can steal the breath from         your lungs.” – Warning about a Purity user who can yank air         (or life-force) from a body.
Context: “Steal” in         magical parlance became associated with anti-magic actions and         certain predatory uses of Soulpulse. The catastrophic event was         dubbed “Steal Breaks Open” because the suppression field         attempted to steal (dampen/collect) the ambient magic and         instead broke reality[143][144].         Afterwards, many practitioners equated “steal” with any attempt         to suppress or control their magic unjustly. Anti-magic laws were         denounced as “stealing freedom.” On the flip side, Purity and         Entropy users developed actual stealing techniques: Purity         “siphoners” who could steal poison or vitality from a foe, and         Entropy Releasers who could gently steal pain (transferring it to         themselves to spare another – though they’d say “share” for         that, not steal). In slang, “steal your resonance” became         a fearsome threat – the idea one could be left Hollow by an enemy         pulling the magic out of you. People also started calling the         suppression squad soldiers “Stealers”, with a capital S,         as a derogatory term. Interestingly, in everyday chat “to steal         resonance” took on a meaning similar to stealing thunder – if         someone solved a problem magically before you had a chance, you         might joke “hey, you stole my resonance!” meaning you took the         chance to shine. But more seriously, “Soul-thief” emerged         as a term for anyone using Soulpulse immorally to dominate or harm,         carrying heavy stigma.

Hollow /         Hollowing:
 Literal Meaning: A state of being emptied         of magic (and motivation), or the process leading to that         state[89].
Usage:         “He’s just a Hollow now – the light’s gone         out of him.” – Describing a victim of overuse[89].         “That route is a dead end, you’ll hollow out         before you finish.” – Senior warning junior about an         unsustainable technique.
Context: Initially a technical         term for the incurable burnout of one’s Soulpulse[89],         “Hollow” quickly entered common usage to describe anything         greatly diminished. People talked about “hollow grid”         when an area’s infrastructure lacked energy or a “hollow man”         for someone who lost their drive (not necessarily magically). It         became a metaphor for depression or defeat. But as a proper noun,         “the Hollowed” referred to those mages who lost their powers. By         N05, a bit of superstition grew around them – some said the         Hollowed could hear the voice of the void or that they were immune         to further magical harm (not entirely true but they often became         very calm, having nothing to lose). The term “hollow victory”         got extra weight if it was won at too high a magical cost (e.g., you         stopped the villain but half your team hollowed themselves in the         effort). There’s also an expression from Prism phase: “Hollow         or hallowed”, implying someone will either burn out or ascend         to greatness – reflecting the thin line practitioners walked.

Quake /         Shatter / Break: (various related terms)
These terms took         on layered meanings. “Quake” was used as a verb for sudden         resonance disruptions (“my heart quaked with that discord” or         “their line quaked under our harmonic attack”). “Shatter”         besides its normal meaning became shorthand for catastrophic failure         (“That spell backlash nearly shattered my veins”).         “Break” especially, after Fathom Break, became ominous – “to         break” could mean to reach a critical failure, often with context         (e.g., “Vein-break” for a severe internal magical         rupture, or the colloquial “to break reality” meaning to         do something impossible or disastrous). Practitioners might         half-joke if something weird happened, “We didn’t break the         world again, did we?” referencing the Fathom event.

God-terms         (Formies, Whollies, Purists, Enders): After the ascension of the         four, slang emerged for their devotees. “Formies” or         “Stoneheads” for Xilcore’s rigid followers, “Whollies”         or “Sweets” for Leesa’s compassionate faithful,         “Purists” (already a term, but now with religious weight,         sometimes “Bleaches” insinuating they bleach the world of         color), and “Enders” (which was already the faction name         for Releasers, now doubling for Seeri’s enlightened but nihilistic         followers). These aren’t magic terms per se, but show how everyday         language adapted to the divine resonance era.
This living lexicon demonstrates how intimately integrated Soulpulse became in daily life. People curse, joke, and worry in resonance terms now. A farmer might say his old plow is “dissonant” with the soil if it keeps snagging, or a lover might tell their partner their “hearts hum in harmony.” Technical terms like attunement and dissonance left the labs and entered taverns and bedrooms. The world’s language resonated with Soulpulse – quite literally, words tied to sound and vibration proliferated as metaphors for emotion and action. In the Confluence Chronicles, mastering the magic also meant speaking its language, and as the series concludes, that language has become the shared tongue of a transformed society.
Through this structured document, we have unraveled the complexities of the Soulpulse magic system – from its theoretical underpinnings and mechanical laws to its evolution, cultural integration, and the poetry of its everyday usage. It is a system born in crisis, forged through collaboration and conflict, and brought to a breaking point where magic and world fundamentally changed. As intricate and rule-bound as it is, Soulpulse remains at its core about resonance – finding harmony amid chaos. In the Chronicles, that principle echoed in characters’ hearts as much as in their powers. Brandon Sanderson once said that a good magic system should not only have clear rules but also reflect the themes of the story; in Confluence Chronicles, the Soulpulse system does exactly that, blending scientific logic with a deep sense of poetic interconnection, as the people of Te’Oga learn that only by understanding the “song” of the world can they hope to heal it, or even survive it.[

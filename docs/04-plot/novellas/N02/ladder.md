    # Novella Ladder — N02

    **Purpose:** Standardized scaffold for N02, inheriting all prior knowledge gates and continuity anchors. Use this doc to plan, then fill chapter stubs in `/chapters`.

    ## Knowledge Rollup (N01 → N02)
    ### N01 — Allowed
- Instinctive effects (healing/shaping) exist post-Piercing
- Costs exist (pain, exhaustion, tremor/burn)
- No formal system language

**N01 — Forbidden (Lint Regex):** `resonance|principle|veins?|Hollowing|Confluence|suppression|faction(s)?|god-?vessel(s)?`

### N02 — Allowed
- Three affinities emerging (Structural, Continuity, Purity)
- Frequency matching concept appears
- Named failure modes: vein-snap, cascade, sympathetic overload
- Costs tracked (vein-burn, calcification, isolation)

**N02 — Forbidden (Lint Regex):** `four principles|Hollowing|dual-?principle|Confluence|suppression|god-?vessel(s)?`


    ## Continuity Anchors Snapshot
    ### Continuity Anchors (Rollup)

- **Jhace:** N01: baseline tremor; N02: ~2.5 cm burn
- **Tiffani:** N01: stiffness seeds; N02: stiffness + pain
- **Mobel:** N01: numbness trend; N02: isolation + swelling
- **Venn/Eries:** N01–N02: early fatigue; N03: visibly older

    ## Notes
    - If N02 deviates from the anchor values, justify on-page (injury, rest, or new technique).
    - Keep sensory FX era-appropriate; no leakage from later lexicon.

## THE SIX TURNINGS FRAMEWORK

### **Metaphysical Structure:**

**Each Turning = 5 Novellas = ~350,000 words**

The saga is organized around **glassforging/metalworking metaphors**:

1. **GLASS (N01-N05):** Raw material exposed to heat (disaster)
2. **STEEL (N06-N10):** Forging under pressure (resistance forms)
3. **LATTICE (N11-N15):** Complex patterns emerge (ideological war)
4. **ALLOY (N16-N20):** Elements blend (corruption of resistance)
5. **CAST (N21-N25):** Mold takes shape (infiltration/revelation)
6. **WELD (N26-N30):** Final joining/breaking (apocalyptic climax)

---

## TURNING ONE: GLASS (N01-N05)
### "From Disaster to Divinity"

**Time Span:** Year 423 (Fiergetide) → Year 424 (mid-Shapetide)

- **N03:** Corruption/violence introduced, Bram dies, guilds fracture
- **N04:** Hollowing crisis, Tiffani reveals dual-principle mastery, Corlexi Hollows
- **N05:** Suppression device catastrophe, Tiffani dies, Confluence manifests, four gods awaken

### **Novella Titles & Functions:**

| **Novella** | **Title** | **Function** | **Climax** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **N01** | "Grip That Holds" | Inciting disaster, magic discovery, hope born | Infrastructure stabilized, partnership sealed |
| **N02** | "Light Cracks Through" | Systematization begins, complexity discovered | Stress-riser averted, factions forming |
| **N03** | "Alloy Folded Wrong" | Violence erupts, corruption revealed, first major death | Bram dies, Jhace/Tiffani deepest bond |
| **N04** | "Shatter From Heat" | Limits confronted, secrets revealed, ambition fails | Jhace nearly dies, Tiffani saves him, Corlexi Hollows |
| **N05** | "Steal Breaks Open" | Catastrophic transformation, tragic sacrifice | Tiffani dies, gods awaken, world ends |

### **Turning One Endpoints:**

**World State:**

- Governance: Traditional councils → god-factions forming
- Magic: Instinctive discovery → Four Principles formalized
- Population: Unified survivors → factional divisions hardening

**Power Structure:**
- **Jhace:** Local hero → Confluence-bearer, resistance leader
- **Tiffani:** Mentor/partner → Dead (permanent, memory only)
- **Four Gods:** Mortals with compulsions → Transformed divine beings

**Thematic State:**
- Hope vs. Despair: From hope (N01) → devastating loss (N05)

- Human Agency: Full autonomy → gods threaten free will
- Love: Partnership formed → love lost to sacrifice

**Reader Experience:**
First arc feels like natural disaster survival story → transforms into god-conflict saga. Tiffani's death ensures emotional investment. Jhace's unique Confluence makes him credible god-opponent.

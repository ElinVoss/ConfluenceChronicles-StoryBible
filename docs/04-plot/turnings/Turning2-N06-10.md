---

## SECTION 1: N06 — "CALLED FROM REFUGE" (CHAPTERS 1-15)

**Key Events:** Jhace processes Tiffani's death, teaches in her memory, Marisse appears, resistance network begins, god-domains consolidate  
**POV Distribution:** Jhace (10 chapters), Marisse (3 chapters), Kylar (2 chapters)

### **CHAPTER 1: JHACE — "GRIEF'S WEIGHT"**

**POV:** Jhace Torrins  
**Time:** Days after N05 ending (Steal Breaks Open aftermath)  
**Location:** Makeshift camp amid N05 battlefield ruins

**Beat:** **Breath Catch** (world has changed; overwhelming loss)

**Opening Scene:**
- Jhace sits alone amid rubble, cradling space where Tiffani died
- Tiffani's burial occurred off-page (between N05/N06)
- Her grave: simple stone marker with glass-forge symbol
- Jhace hasn't slept since her death; hands won't stop shaking

**Sensory Detail:**
- **Sight:** Floating landmass (Steal Breaks Open) hovering on horizon, lattice dust storms
- **Sound:** Unnatural silence (vein-shatter earthquakes ended permanently)
- **Smell:** Smoke, copper-ozone from lingering Soulpulse discharge
- **Touch:** Tiffani's toolkit in his lap (all he has left of her)

**Survivors Approach:**
- ~40-50 people survived N05 catastrophe
- Mixture of practitioners, soldiers, civilians
- Look to Jhace for leadership (he's the Confluence user who held off gods)
- He's emotionally incapable of responding

**Marisse Appears:**
- Arrives at camp (traveled from distant city)
- She's older, graying, vein-burn visible on arms
- Kneels beside Jhace: "She was my student. I taught her everything. And she taught you."
- First time Jhace learns Tiffani studied under someone

**Jhace's Response:**
- Too numb to process new information
- Marisse: "Grief later. Right now, people need you."
- Jhace: "I can't. I don't know how to do this without her."
- Marisse: "Then you learn. That's what she'd want."

**Final Line:**  
*"Jhace looked at Tiffani's tools, felt the weight of fifty pairs of eyes on his back, and understood: grief was a luxury he couldn't afford. Not yet."*

**Key Relationships:**
- **Jhace/Marisse:** First meeting; she's link to Tiffani's past; offers mentorship
- **Jhace/Survivors:** They see him as leader; he sees himself as broken

**Emotional State:** Devastation → numb survival mode

**Soulpulse Status:** Jhace can use Confluence but barely processing it; exhausted from N05

---

### **CHAPTER 2: MARISSE — "TEACHER'S BURDEN"**

**POV:** Marisse  
**Time:** Same day, hours later  
**Location:** Camp perimeter

**Beat:** **Pressure Knot** (assessing situation; formulating plan)

**Opening Scene:**
- Marisse walks camp perimeter, taking stock
- Observes survivors: injured, traumatized, supplies low
- Four god-factions now active across Te'Oga (reports trickling in)

**Marisse's Internal Monologue:**
- She trained Tiffani decades ago (before Piercing)
- Recognized Tiffani's brilliance and coldness
- Guilt: Wonders if she failed as teacher
- Resolve: Won't fail Jhace the same way

**Strategic Assessment:**
- Camp unsustainable long-term (no food, water sources unreliable)
- God-factions will expand territories; survivors caught in crossfire inevitable
- Need: Organized resistance network with safe houses, supply lines
- Problem: Jhace barely functional; needs time to grieve

**Meeting Kylar:**
- Kylar (from N01-N05, now seasoned practitioner) approaches
- Reports: Scouts found abandoned Underface district (Grindheim outskirts)
- Could serve as first safe house
- Kylar: "Should we tell Jhace?"
- Marisse: "Not yet. Let him process. We'll handle groundwork."

**Marisse's Decision:**
- She'll organize logistics, train new practitioners
- Jhace gets one week to grieve properly
- Then he leads (whether ready or not)

**Final Line:**  
*"Marisse watched Jhace's silhouette against the burning horizon and made a silent vow: Tiffani's death would not be in vain. They would build something that mattered."*

**Key Relationships:**
- **Marisse/Jhace:** Protective mentorship forming; she sees Tiffani in him
- **Marisse/Kylar:** Mutual respect; both pragmatic leaders

**Emotional State:** Grief for Tiffani → resolve to honor her legacy

**Soulpulse Status:** Marisse = Form specialist; hands tremor from decades of use

---

### **CHAPTER 3: JHACE — "FIRST LESSON"**

- Five young survivors (teens/early 20s) want to learn Soulpulse
- Jhace resists: "I'm not ready for this."
- Marisse: "You're never ready. Tiffani taught you that."

- Jhace demonstrates basic Wholeness technique (mending cracked bowl)
- His hands shake badly; nearly fails
- Memories of Tiffani teaching him (N01 flashbacks) flood back

**Student Interactions:**
- One student: Rennik (becomes important later; medic-in-training)

- Rennik: "It's okay to be sad. She must've been important."
- Jhace: "She was everything."
- Continues lesson through tears

**Marisse Observes:**
- Stands aside, nodding approval
- Whispers to Kylar: "He'll make it. Eventually."

**Final Line:**  
*"Jhace taught through grief, and in teaching, found the first thread of purpose pulling him back from the void."*

**Key Relationships:**
- **Jhace/Rennik:** Apprentice bond forming; Rennik = medic focus
- **Jhace/Students:** Surrogate for lost connections (Bram, Tiffani, Chloen from N02)

**Emotional State:** Numbness cracking → grief expressed → purpose glimpsed

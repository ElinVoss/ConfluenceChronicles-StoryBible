  - "Midpoint: First glimpse of Confluence's true cost through a failed working"
  - "Act II: Mobel's isolation symptoms become undeniable"

pov_structure: "dual_pov"  # Jhace and Tiffani alternating chapters

special_constraints:
  - "Tiffani's narrative voice: elegant prose with punched profanity, NOT grimdark yet"
  - "Jhace's narrative voice: blunt, physical, action-oriented with emotional undercurrent"
  - "Magic should feel like a gift turning into a curse, not a tool"
  - "First three chapters must establish world, characters, and stakes before any Confluence"

# ADDITIONAL NOTES
# ================

# This is an exemplar brief for N01, the opening novella of the saga.
# When creating briefs for other novellas:
#
# 1. Adjust forbidden_elements based on knowledge gates for that era
#    - N02-N03: Can use "resonance," "frequency matching," three affinities
#    - N04: Can use "Hollowing," "dual-principle," four principles theorized
#    - N05+: Full terminology available
#
# 2. Ensure continuity_hooks reference actual prior novellas
#    - Track cost progression (vein-burn cm, calcification severity, etc.)
#    - Reference character arcs from previous novellas
#    - Set up future beats without spoiling
#
# 3. Adjust tone_pillars as saga evolves
#    - Early novellas: intimate, discovery-focused
#    - Mid-saga: factional conflict, weaponization
#    - Late saga: cosmic stakes, transformation, world-breaking
#
# 4. Verify required_characters are appropriate for the era
#    - Some characters transform into god-vessels in N05
#    - Track who's alive, transformed, or dead at each point
#
# 5. Align must_hit_beats with Turning structure
#    - Reference docs/04-plot/turnings/Turning<X>-N<XX-XX>.md
#    - Ensure novella beats serve larger Turning arc

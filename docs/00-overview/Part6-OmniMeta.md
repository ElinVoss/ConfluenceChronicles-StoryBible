## SECTION 1: TE'OGA GEOGRAPHY

### **Planet Overview:**

**Te'Oga** = Single supercontinent world  
**Climate:** Varied (tropical south, temperate center, arctic north)  
**Population (Pre-Piercing):** ~30 million  
**Key Feature:** Vein-network (natural energy channels beneath surface)

---

### **Major Regions:**

---

### **The Piercing (Ground Zero):**

**Location:** Central Te'Oga, 50km north of Coreven  
**Appearance:** 30km diameter hole, perfectly cylindrical  
**Depth:** Unknown (descends beyond measurement)  
**Effect:** Destabilized vein-network, triggered Soulpulse awakening

**Post-Piercing:** Area radioactive-equivalent (Soulpulse saturation), uninhabitable

---

## SECTION 2: SOULPULSE MAGIC SYSTEM

### **What is Soulpulse?**

**Soulpulse** = Manipulation of vein-network energy through will/emotion

**Discovery:** Post-Piercing spontaneous awakening (Year 423)  
**Nature:** Energy responsive to human conviction/emotional intensity  
**Source:** Planet's vein-network (underground energy channels)

---

### **Four Principles:**

**1. FORM (Structure/Order)**
- **Function:** Shapes matter, creates geometric constructs, hardens defenses
- **Emotional Driver:** Desire for order, control, perfection
- **Physical Sign:** Veins glow blue-white, geometric patterns on skin
- **Cost:** Rigidity, brittleness if overused

**Examples:**
- Create crystalline barriers
- Shape tools/weapons from raw material
- Reinforce structures geometrically

---

**2. WHOLENESS (Connection/Healing)**
- **Function:** Heals injuries, connects minds empathically, integrates systems
- **Emotional Driver:** Compassion, desire for unity, love
- **Physical Sign:** Veins glow golden, warmth radiating from hands
- **Cost:** Emotional bleeding (feel others' pain), boundary dissolution

**Examples:**
- Heal wounds (physical/psychological)
- Sense others' emotions
- Create empathic networks

---

**3. PURITY (Cleansing/Isolation)**
- **Function:** Burns impurities, severs connections, isolates perfection
- **Emotional Driver:** Desire for cleanliness, rejection of flaws
- **Physical Sign:** Veins glow white-hot, flames around extremities
- **Cost:** Cold isolation, inability to connect

**Examples:**
- Purge toxins/diseases
- Sever unwanted connections (mental/physical)
- Cleanse corruption

---

**4. ENTROPY (Dissolution/Release)**
- **Function:** Decays matter, releases tension, accelerates endings
- **Emotional Driver:** Acceptance, surrender, peace with impermanence
- **Physical Sign:** Veins glow gray-mist, cold numbness
- **Cost:** Passivity, difficulty fighting/persisting

**Examples:**
- Accelerate decay (structures, bodies)
- Release tension/pain peacefully
- Induce acceptance/surrender

---

### **Confluence (Fifth State):**

**Definition:** All four principles used simultaneously

**Requirements:**
- Mastery of all four principles individually
- Paradox tolerance (holding opposites: order/chaos, connection/isolation)
- Extreme emotional/conviction intensity

**Effect:**
- Reality warping (principles merge, physics unstable)
- Traps entities in paradox (Fivefold Stasis)
- **Terminal Cost:** Calcification, inevitable death

**Users:**
- Jhace (spontaneous N05, mastered N25)
- Gods (cannot use—too absolute in single principles)

---

### **Soulpulse Costs & Limits:**

**Physical Costs:**
- **Vein-burn:** Visible darkening of veins from overuse
- **Hollowing:** Terminal exhaustion when conviction fails
- **Calcification:** Meta-Confluence terminal state (body petrifies)

**Psychological Costs:**
- **Conviction Drain:** Losing sense of purpose/meaning
- **Emotional Bleeding:** Feeling others' pain (Wholeness)
- **Isolation:** Inability to connect (Purity)
- **Passivity:** Difficulty persisting (Entropy)

**Limits:**
- Requires emotional/conviction fuel (cannot use mechanically)
- Overuse leads to Hollowing (death from conviction failure)
- Confluence = terminal (body cannot sustain paradox long-term)

---

## SECTION 3: POLITICAL STRUCTURES

### **Pre-Piercing Governance:**

**Resonance Bureau:**
- **Function:** Central government, infrastructure management, research
- **Structure:** Elected council (12 members), 4-year terms
- **Philosophy:** Pragmatic bureaucracy, prioritize stability
- **Collapse:** N05 (gods awaken, Bureau dissolves)

**Regional Autonomy:**
- Cities maintain local governance (mayors, councils)
- Bureau handles coordination, not day-to-day rule

---

### **Post-Piercing Governance:**

**Four God-Domains (N05+):**

**Xilcore's Domain (Form):**
- **Structure:** Perfect hierarchy (geometric organization)
- **Leadership:** Xilcore + lieutenants (Orveth chief architect)
- **Population Control:** Strict conformity, deviation punished
- **Economy:** Centrally planned, perfectly efficient

**Leesa's Domain (Wholeness):**
- **Structure:** Network consciousness (hive-mind lite)
- **Leadership:** Leesa + empathic council (Thessa chief integrator)
- **Population Control:** Voluntary absorption (mostly), forcible if resisted
- **Economy:** Resource-sharing collective, no individual ownership

**Blemo's Domain (Purity):**
- **Structure:** Theocratic purge-state
- **Leadership:** Blemo + purge squads (Lysenne former lieutenant)
- **Population Control:** Constant cleansing, impure killed
- **Economy:** Minimal (purified need little), scavenged resources

**Seeri's Domain (Entropy):**
- **Structure:** Loose acceptance communes
- **Leadership:** Seeri + peaceful guides (Daric chief)
- **Population Control:** Voluntary surrender (no enforcement)
- **Economy:** Decaying infrastructure, minimal trade

---

**Resistance Governance (N06+):**
- **Structure:** Military hierarchy (Jhace commander, lieutenants beneath)
- **Leadership:** Jhace + Chloen (combat), Kylar (strategy), Marisse (ethics until N20)
- **Population:** ~100 (N06) → 2,000 (N10) → 200 (N20) → 50 (N25) → 15 (N30)
- **Decision-Making:** Consensus-driven but Jhace has final say

---

## SECTION 4: CULTURAL ELEMENTS

### **Language:**

**Te'Ogan (Common Tongue):**
- Structure: Phonetic, verb-final syntax
- Writing: Geometric script (pre-Piercing standardized)
- Post-Piercing: God-domains develop dialect variations
  - Form: Geometric precision language
  - Wholeness: Empathic impression language
  - Purity: Cleansed minimalist language
  - Entropy: Peaceful acceptance language

---

### **Social Structures (Pre-Piercing):**

**Class System:** Merit-based (skill determines status)
- **Artisans:** Forge-workers, engineers (high status)
- **Scholars:** Resonance researchers (high status)
- **Laborers:** Standard workers (mid status)
- **Service:** Hospitality, maintenance (lower status)

**Family Structure:** Nuclear families common, extended kin networks valued

**Education:** Mandatory basic schooling, specialized apprenticeships

---

### **Customs & Traditions:**

**Naming Convention:**
- Given name + Surname (e.g., Jhace Torrins, Tiffani Karress)
- Surnames often occupation-based (Torrins = "torch-keeper")

**Death Rituals (Pre-Piercing):**
- Cremation common, ashes scattered at vein-nodes
- Memorial stones engraved with names/achievements

**Death Rituals (Post-Piercing):**
- Resistance: Quick burials, memorials improvised
- Gods: Doctrine-specific (Form crystallizes, Wholeness integrates, Purity burns, Entropy dissolves)

---

## SECTION 5: TECHNOLOGY LEVEL

### **Infrastructure (Pre-Piercing):**

**Power:** Vein-network tapped for energy (stable, renewable)  
**Transportation:** Railways, ground vehicles (no flight)  
**Communication:** Telegraph-equivalent (vein-pulse signals)  
**Manufacturing:** Industrial-age level (forges, factories, mechanized)

---

### **Weapons (Pre-Piercing):**

**Standard:** Metal tools repurposed (hammers, bars, knives)  
**Combat:** Rare (military minimal, police forces only)  
**Philosophy:** Weapons unnecessary in stable society

---

### **Weapons (Post-Piercing):**

**Resistance:**
- **Physical:** Improvised (wrenches, rebar, scavenged)
- **Soulpulse:** Primary weapon (Form barriers, Wholeness healing, Purity attacks, Entropy dissolution)

**Gods:**
- **Physical:** Minimal (followers gifted, not armed)
- **Soulpulse:** Overwhelming (god-level mastery)

---

### **Medical Technology:**

**Pre-Piercing:** Surgery, pharmaceuticals (industrial-age medicine)  
**Post-Piercing:** Wholeness healing primary (Rennik + healers), conventional medicine collapsed

---

---

## SECTION 7: ECONOMIC SYSTEMS

### **Pre-Piercing Economy:**

**Currency:** Energy credits (vein-network usage-based)  
**Trade:** Internal (continent-wide), no external (single supercontinent)  
**Industries:**
- Manufacturing (largest sector)
- Agriculture (secondary)
- Services (tertiary)

**Economic Philosophy:** Mixed economy (Bureau regulates, private enterprise allowed)

---

### **Post-Piercing Economy:**

**N05-N10:** Collapse of currency system  
- Barter economy emerges
- Scavenging primary resource acquisition

**N11-N20:** Faction-specific economies  
- God-domains: Doctrine-based (Form perfect efficiency, Wholeness sharing, Purity minimal, Entropy decaying)
- Resistance: Pure scavenging, raiding

**N21-N30:** No economy (war total, survival only)

---

## SECTION 8: RELIGIOUS & PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITIONS

### **Pre-Piercing Beliefs:**

**Dominant Philosophy:** Pragmatic Materialism
- No organized religion
- Belief in observable reality only
- Vein-network understood scientifically (not spiritually)

**Minority Beliefs:**
- Resonance mysticism (fringe belief vein-network conscious)
- Cyclical reincarnation (small cultural pockets)

---

### **Post-Piercing Beliefs:**

**God Doctrines (Forced Conversions):**

**Form (Xilcore):**
- Belief: Universe is mathematics, order is salvation
- Practice: Geometric meditation, structural worship

**Wholeness (Leesa):**
- Belief: Separation is suffering, unity is salvation
- Practice: Empathic connection rituals, collective consciousness

**Purity (Blemo):**
- Belief: Imperfection is sin, cleansing is salvation
- Practice: Purification rituals, constant self-examination for flaws

**Entropy (Seeri):**
- Belief: Struggle is pointless, release is salvation
- Practice: Acceptance meditation, surrender ceremonies

---

**Resistance Philosophy:**

**Core Belief:** "Freedom worth any cost" (Tiffani's Principle)

**Practices:**
- Memorial ceremonies for fallen
- Oath-taking (commit to fight until victory or death)
- No religious worship (ideological commitment only)

---

## SECTION 9: VEIN-NETWORK MECHANICS

### **What is the Vein-Network?**

**Natural System:** Underground energy channels (planet's circulatory system)  
**Pre-Piercing Function:** Stable energy source (tapped for power)  
**Post-Piercing State:** Destabilized, reactive to emotion/will (becomes Soulpulse)

---

### **Vein-Network Properties:**

**Visibility:** Glows faintly in darkness, detectable by practitioners  
**Density:** Highest near Piercing site, fades with distance  
**Responsiveness:** Stronger response to intense conviction/emotion  
**Regeneration:** Slow (decades to heal damage)

---

### **Vein-Node Locations:**

**Major Nodes (Pre-Piercing Power Stations):**
- Coreven Central Node
- Silthmark Industrial Node
- Havenor Port Node
- Ashpeak Mining Node

**Post-Piercing:** Nodes become god-domain power centers (each god claims one)

---

## SECTION 10: FAUNA & FLORA

### **Animals:**

**Mammals:** Standard Earth-equivalents (deer, wolves, bears in north; herbivores in plains)  
**Birds:** Diverse (flightless variants in southern marshes)  
**Fish:** Marine and freshwater varieties  
**Post-Piercing:** Many species extinct (casualties of war), survivors adapt to Soulpulse saturation

---

### **Plants:**

**Flora:** Standard Earth-equivalents (forests, grasslands, crops)  
**Post-Piercing:** Some plants mutate (absorb Soulpulse, glow faintly), most unaffected

---

## SECTION 11: THE SUPPRESSION DEVICE (N01-N05)

### **Purpose:**

**Function:** Contain vein-network destabilization post-Piercing  
**Design:** Geometric resonance dampener (absorbs excess energy)  
**Location:** Ground zero (Piercing site)

---

### **Construction:**

**Timeline:** Year 423-425 (built across N02-N04)  
**Architect:** Resonance Bureau engineers  
**Outcome:** Partially successful (contains destabilization temporarily)

---

### **Failure (N05):**

**Cause:** Vein-network saturation exceeded suppression capacity  
**Result:** Device overloads, explodes, releases accumulated energy  
**Consequence:** Four gods awaken (energy crystallizes into conscious entities)

---

## SECTION 12: WRITING CONSISTENCY NOTES

### **Geography Consistency:**

- Northern = cold/mountains (Xilcore)
- Southern = warm/plains (Leesa)
- Eastern = hot/deserts (Blemo)
- Western = cool/mist (Seeri)
- Central = temperate/urban (contested)

---

### **Soulpulse Mechanics Consistency:**

- Always requires emotional/conviction fuel
- Costs escalate with use (vein-burn → Hollowing → calcification)
- Confluence = terminal (cannot be used casually)
- Gods cannot use Confluence (too absolute in single principles)

---

### **Timeline Consistency:**

- Piercing = Year 423
- N01-N05 = ~24 months
- Each Turning = ~24 months (except Turning Six = 6 months)
- Total saga span = ~9 years (423-432)

---

### **Population Consistency:**

- Pre-Piercing: ~30M
- Post-N30: ~7M (23M dead from war/purges/apocalypse)
- Resistance survivors: 15 (named: Vael, Selwin, Brighlee, Miri + 11 unnamed)

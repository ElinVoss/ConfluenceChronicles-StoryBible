## SECTION 1: POLITICAL ADVANTAGE MATRIX (N01-N30)

### **Legend:**
- **Strong:** Faction dominates politically/militarily, initiates action
- **Edge:** Faction holds slight advantage, maintains tempo
- **Parity:** Factions evenly matched, stalemate or rapid swings
- **Weak:** Faction on defensive, responding rather than initiating
- **Eliminated:** Faction destroyed, no longer player

## SECTION 2: TERRITORY CONTROL DYNAMICS

### **N01-N05: Pre-Divine World**

**Territorial Control:**
- Te'Oga unified under Resonance Bureau governance
- City-states maintain regional autonomy
- Infrastructure network intact
- Vein-network monitored but not weaponized

**N05 Endpoint:**
- Piercing creates 30km hole (ground zero)
- Four god-domains begin crystallizing
- Resistance controls scattered safe houses only

---

### **N06-N10: Domain Formation**

**Territory Division:**

**Xilcore (Form) — Northern Territories:**
- Crystalline citadels, geometric perfection
- Population: ~5M aligned (Year 425)
- Infrastructure: Perfect order, rigid control
- Border: Hard crystalline walls, no infiltration

**Leesa (Wholeness) — Southern Territories:**
- Golden-lit empathic zones
- Population: ~8M integrated (Year 425)
- Infrastructure: Network consciousness, hive harmony
- Border: Soft empathic field, willing entrants

**Blemo (Purity) — Eastern Territories:**
- Ash-marked purged zones, white flames
- Population: ~3M purified (Year 425)
- Infrastructure: Cleansed, sterile, isolated
- Border: Flame barriers, deadly to impure

**Seeri (Entropy) — Western Territories:**
- Gray mist, peaceful dissolution
- Population: ~2M accepted (Year 425)
- Infrastructure: Decaying peacefully, minimal maintenance
- Border: Mist veil, persuasive acceptance

**Resistance — Scattered:**
- No unified territory
- Safe houses in neutral zones
- ~2,000 fighters mobile
- ~10,000 civilian supporters hiding

---

### **N11-N15: Open Warfare**

**Territory Shifts:**
- Neutral zones shrinking (50% by N15)
- Gods battle each other for territory
- Resistance holds one allied stronghold (N13-N15)
- Borders fluctuate based on god-conflicts

**N15 Endpoint:**
- Allied stronghold survives siege barely
- 80% of Te'Oga under god-control
- 15% neutral (shrinking)
- 5% resistance-held (one stronghold + scattered cells)

---

### **N16-N20: Consolidation & Collapse**

**Territory Dynamics:**
- Gods consolidate, reduce inter-god warfare
- Resistance loses allied stronghold N19 (betrayal)
- By N20: 90% god-controlled, 10% contested/neutral

**N20 Endpoint:**
- Resistance no unified territory
- Survivors scattered in cells (~200 fighters)
- Gods coordinate to eliminate resistance completely

---

### **N21-N25: Convergence**

**Territory Dynamics:**
- All four god-armies converge toward single point (resistance stronghold)
- Territory irrelevant—focus on annihilation
- Resistance ~50-100 fighters in final stronghold

**N25 Endpoint:**
- Battlefield = single location
- Gods converge physically
- Territory control meaningless (world frozen in stasis)

---

### **N26-N30: Apocalypse & Aftermath**

**Territory Dynamics:**
- N26-N29: Reality warping, territory unstable
- N30: Gods eliminated, domains collapse
- Endpoint: Empty world, no governance, 15 survivors

---

---

### **Turning Three: Lattice (N11-N15)**

**N11:** Open fronts established (no more hiding, public warfare)  
**N12:** Humanitarian crisis (witness Leesa's purges, 1M+ civilians killed)

**N14:** **Shadow Lattice** (infiltration network peak, embedded agents placed)  
**N15:** **Insider** (allied stronghold siege, pyrrhic survival, Kylar dies)

---

### **Turning Four: Alloy (N16-N20)**

**N16:** **Poison in the Well** (Lysenne defects, provides intelligence, destabilizes Blemo)  
**N17:** Necessary evils (sabotage operations, civilian collateral, ethical collapse begins)  
**N18:** Internal fracture (Marisse vs. Jhace, ideological split)  
**N19:** **Betrayal's Price** (internal traitor reveals safe houses, mass arrests)

**N26:** **Breaking Point Reached** (battle royale, Orveth dies crushed)  
**N27:** **Revelation Unfolds** (Thessa killed by Jhace, all gods attack simultaneously)

**N06-N10:** Scavenging + raiding neutral zones  
**N11-N15:** Allied stronghold provides base  
**N16-N20:** Scattered cells, no centralized supply  
**N21-N25:** One month reserves, no resupply  
**N26-N30:** No supplies, apocalyptic battle

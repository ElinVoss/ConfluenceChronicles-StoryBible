## THE FOUR GODS — Overview

**Common Origin:** Awakened N05 when suppression device fails  
**Nature:** Post-Piercing entities, embody single Soulpulse principles to extreme  
**Motivation:** Each genuinely believes their doctrine = salvation  
**Fatal Flaw:** Absolute conviction (incapable of compromise, cannot coexist)  
**Endpoint:** All four killed systematically N30 Ch1-13

---

### **GOD ONE: XILCORE (FORM) — Perfect Order**

**Domain:** Northern territories (crystalline structures, geometric perfection)  
**Philosophy:** "Order must prevail. Chaos cannot stand."  
**Power:** Master of Form principle—shapes reality through perfect geometry  
**Fatal Flaw:** Predictability (geometric patterns repeat, exploitable by chaos)

#### **Arc Summary:**
- **N05:** Awakens, establishes Form doctrine, crystalline citadels rise
- **N07:** Domain stabilizes, followers attracted to order/structure

- **N25:** Personally attacks Jhace, trapped in fivefold stasis
- **N26:** Lieutenant **Orveth dies** (crushed by own perfect fortress)
- **N30 Ch3-5:** **KILLED** (geometric structure shattered by entropy injection)

**Philosophy Deep Dive:**
- Believes: Universe requires perfect structure to function
- Goal: Impose mathematical order on all existence
- Method: Convert followers through logic, eliminate chaos sources
- Followers: Engineers, architects, bureaucrats attracted to certainty
- Weakness: Cannot adapt to unpredictability (Jhace's paradox)

### **GOD TWO: LEESA (WHOLENESS) — Perfect Unity**

**Domain:** Southern territories (golden light, empathic networks)  
**Philosophy:** "Unity will heal. Individuality is suffering."  
**Power:** Master of Wholeness principle—connects minds, heals through absorption  
**Fatal Flaw:** Requires connection (forced isolation = death)

#### **Arc Summary:**

- Believes: Suffering comes from separation, unity = salvation
- Goal: Integrate all consciousness into single collective
- Method: Empathic persuasion, overwhelming love, forcible absorption if resisted
- Followers: Lonely, traumatized, seeking connection/belonging
- Weakness: Individuality too strong (Jhace's paradox resists)

---

### **GOD THREE: BLEMO (PURITY) — Perfect Cleansing**

**Domain:** Eastern territories (white flames, ash-marked purged zones)  
**Philosophy:** "Purity demands cleansing. Imperfection is sin."

**Philosophy Deep Dive:**
- Believes: Imperfection = contamination, must be eliminated
- Goal: Cleanse world to perfect state
- Method: Identify flaws, burn them away, isolate perfection
- Followers: Zealots, perfectionists, self-hating seeking redemption

---

### **GOD FOUR: SEERI (ENTROPY) — Perfect Release**

**Domain:** Western territories (gray mist, quiet acceptance)  
**Philosophy:** "Release is mercy. Struggle is pointless."

- **N29:** Trapped in stasis, doesn't resist (accepts fate)
- **N30 Ch10-13:** **KILLED LAST** (peaceful self-dissolution, assists own termination)

**Philosophy Deep Dive:**
- Believes: Struggle = suffering, release = kindness
- Goal: Help all beings accept endings peacefully
- Method: Passive persuasion, demonstrate peace through surrender
- Followers: Exhausted, defeated, seeking rest from pain
- Weakness: Won't resist death (Jhace's stasis accepted willingly)
